            <h1>In Level 5</h1>
            <p>a soccer player has reached the highest level of her career: She is now a professional athlete. You
                have made it to the top; now how to do stay there? Maintaining good fitness and nutrition habits
                will help extend your playing years, but truly great players aren’t just stars in the game; they are
                representatives of their teams, their families, and their beliefs. Learn how to be a good role model
                as you express yourself on social media, in public and in the press, and as you interact with
                fans.</p>

        <h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num"><span>5.1</span></span> attitude</h1>
        <p>A positive <span class="keyword">attitude</span> is essential to any athlete’s success both on and off
            the playing field. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> makes a habit of
            demonstrating the following five attributes:</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <!--p247-->
        <h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>
        <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you must continue to demonstrate respect for
            your coaches and game officials, your teammates and opponents, as well as yourself. As a professional
            soccer player, you should also demonstrate respect for the fans who come to see you and your team play.
            If someone asks for your autograph, be gracious and friendly. Remember, without the fans, you might not
            have a team to play on.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At the pro level right now, you’re going to start
            having fans follow you on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram—and come to your games. You’ve got to show a
            lot of respect for those fans.</p>
        <p>At the Super Cup in Sweden, you can see the players hugging fans afterward and just spending a great deal
            of time with them following the game. It is so moving to see little girls absolutely glowing as they get
            autographs from their favorite heroines. As a coach, it makes you proud to see your players making such
            a connection with the fans and as a fan; that moment of genuine engagement can mean so, so much.</p>
        <p>Don’t ever take your fans for granted and don’t ever think you are above meeting them, snapping photos,
            or shaking hands. Your supporters are a huge part of who you are as a player.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When Christen Press got drafted in the first round and
            had to share the front position with Abby Wambach, we talked about how important it was for her to give
            respect to the senior players who have paid their dues. The reason why she’s playing at the level
            <!--p248-->she is, is because these players paved the way for her. It is tremendously important when a
            rookie comes into a team that she gives the respect to the veteran players because of their experience
            and the ways that they can guide younger players on and off the field. It could be the turning point in
            a player growing as an athlete by being willing to be mentored. <span class="attribution">–Ziad</span>

        <h2 id="sportsmanship">Sportsmanship</h2>
        <p><span class="keyword">Good Sportsmanship</span> starts with respect for one’s teammates, opponents,
            coaches, and officials. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> demonstrates good
            sportsmanship by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing by the rules and never cheating</li>
            <li>Acknowledging and encouraging her teammates</li>
            <li>Accepting responsibility for her own mistakes</li>
            <li>Never arguing with the officials</li>
            <li>Winning and losing with grace</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a professional soccer player, you must always remember that you are not the only player on the team.
            Even if you’re a star player, you can’t win a game all by yourself. Demonstrate good sportsmanship by
            giving credit to your teammates and your coaches when you win a game. You should also acknowledge that
            the other team was a formidable opponent.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One of the best examples of sportsman-ship at the
            professional level was the Women’s World Cup final between Japan and the United States. It was supposed
            to be a great matchup, but the game was over by halftime with a score of 4-1. What was so amazing,
            <!--p249-->though, was that the Japanese team never argued with the referees or with one another. They
            stayed respectful and they continued to encourage one another as a team. After the game, they shook
            hands and didn’t act angry. They were being watched by their country and by the whole world, and they
            absolutely shone in terms of what real sportsmanship looks like. They were an example for every team,
            every player, and every coach to learn from. It was amazing to watch. <span

        <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
        <p>A soccer player who reaches the professional ranks will likely join a team that is already a tight-knit
            family. She is going to need to earn the trust of her new teammates and maintain that trust using the
            skills she has learned up to this point.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <!--p250-->
        <h2 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h2>
        <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, a soccer player simply needs to be the <span
                class="keyword">professional</span> that she is being paid to be by representing her team and her
            sport admirably. In addition to the list of do’s and don’ts presented in Level 4, a professional athlete
            must learn how to speak to the media correctly and in a way that presents her team in a good light.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At this level, every player has to understand that it’s
            not about the name on the back of the jersey; it’s about the name on the front of the jersey. Whenever
            you’re doing an interview or doing any charity work or involved in community activities, you’ve got to
            always remember that you’re representing a club, you’re representing your whole roster of that year,
            you’re representing the tradition that club set up in that community, and it’s not about you. It’s about
            the team.</p>
        <p>It’s really important for the players to control their emotions, especially during an interview after a
            heart-breaking loss. Know that there are thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of people
            watching that interview. They are waiting for you to see what you are going to say. Are you going to
            blame a teammate for costing you the game, or are you going to do just the opposite? Are you going to
            say, “We gave it everything and today just wasn’t our day,” or are you going to start pointing fingers?
            Remember that every single thing you say or do at that level is representing your team, your traditions,
            and your community. <span class="attribution">–Ziad</span></p>

        <h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
        <p>Whether or not a student-athlete moves into professional level play, the <span
                class="keyword">leadership</span> skills she has developed over the years will continue to benefit
            her as she leaves college. In corporate America, as on a soccer team, a strong, confident leader can
            inspire a team to accomplish goals that they can’t accomplish on their own. This is one of the many
            reasons why many companies hire former athletes.</p>
        <p>A former player may consider coaching, moving up from introductory levels to higher Levels of coaching.
            According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of coaches is expected to increase much
            faster than the average for all occupations through 2022. Nonetheless, there will be a lot of
            competition for college and professional coaching jobs.</p>
        <p>The athlete who has developed strong leadership skills over the years will be a much more attractive
            candidate, because she will already possess the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Excellent communication skills that allow her to effectively teach and convey information to her
                team
            </li>
            <li>The ability to make quick decisions, especially during games and other high pressure situations</li>
            <li>Effective interpersonal skills that allow her to relate to her players</li>
            <li>Negotiation skills that allow her to solve problems in the best interest of everyone involved</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When you’re in that little tunnel with the opposing
            team lining up next to you, and the referees are right in front of you, and you are waiting for them to
            <!--p252-->give you the green light to step on the field because the TV is going to start, and it’s
            going to be live feeding, and this is when the TV had the cameras on the team in that tunnel … imagine
            that you are standing right across from your opponent and channel that energy into your mind, your body,
            your eyes, and your voice.</p>
        <p>Recently, just before a big Premier League game between Arsenal and Lester on television, there were
            cameras on both teams and about 80,000 fans in attendance waiting for the teams to step onto the field.
            All the players were trying to look sharp in front of the camera and put a smile on their faces, but
            when that green light was given for both teams to walk on the field, Arsenal captain’s whole demeanor
            changed. In an instant it went from, “Yeah, we have a big game right now, lads,” to, “Come on, men,
            we’re going to war and we are representing all of our fans today.” It was an amazing moment to witness
            the leader forget about everything going on around him and shift his mind to a place where he knew he
            had to get his players in that state of mind. <span class="attribution">–Walid and Ziad</span></p>
        <p class="athlete"><span class="keyword">Camille Levin &gt;&gt;</span> I ended up going to Europe when I
            first entered the pros—a lot of Americans do. I was drafted by a Swedish team, and I was fortunate
            because a lot of Swedes speak English very well, so it wasn’t too big of an adjustment. But it can be
            kind of overwhelming at first to be living in a new country and not speaking the language, trying to
            learn a new culture, understanding how people work there, and how things work there in general. At the
            end of the day, though, I was there for soccer, so when you’re on the field, it doesn’t matter where you
            are or where you came from. There are different play styles and different approaches, but we <!--p253-->
            were all there to play soccer. When I was on the field, I was confident in what I was doing and I was in
            my happy place. Wherever you are, at the end of the day, you’re on a soccer field with a ball and your
            team. It doesn’t matter what language they’re speaking or what culture differences there are—ultimately,
            you’re all there for the same reason. That is a pretty neat thing about the sport and how universal it
            is.</p>

            improving on the following:</p>

        <h2 id="lower-body-strength">Lower Body STRENGTH</h2>
        <p>At Level 5, as a professional, you are at the top of your game physically; you are stronger, more
            explosive, healthier, and better balanced than ever before. You are staying fit during crucial
            practices, getting more reps because of it, and seeing the difference on the pitch. If you keep your
            fitness and health during practice and games, it may be the difference to making a higher salary or
            being chosen to play for a national team. Stronger legs have made you faster to the point of contact,
            and you are now out-jumping your opponent for free balls in the air or winning slide tackles. Single-leg
            squats are easier, your balance is top-notch, and your jumping is exceptionally high. Congrats you are
            ready for Level 5 testing and dominating any challenge!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="upper-body-strength">Upper body strength</h2>
        <p>You may now be playing against players 5-10 years older than you. You may be just as skilled, but are you
            just as strong? National coaches will be looking at you to separate yourself from competition, so the
            margin for error is minuscule. At this level, decisions may come down to matchups with other teams just
            as skilled, so skill may not be what is most important at some positions. You don’t want to be on the
            bench due to your lack of strength!</p>

        <h2 id="core-strength">Core Strength</h2>
        <p>You are in the best shape of your life, playing against some of the most elite players in the world, and
            every athlete is out to either beat you or take your job—so staying healthy can be as important as
            scoring a goal. This is where having a strong core can be crucial for a soccer player. You need your
            hips to be strong to deliver accurate, crisp passes, and your lower back needs to be able to support all
            the torque that comes with kicking a ball powerfully. A weakness in your core simply means you are
            likely going to be injured sooner rather than later.</p>

        <h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num"><span>5.5</span></span> LIFESTYLE</h1>
        <p>For student-athletes who become one of the rare few who move on to the professional level in their sport,
            life can sometimes feel like an open book. More people are watching them play, and they are more in the
            public eye than ever before. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> is one who
            continues to successfully balance all the elements in her life, including:</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <!--p271-->
        <h2 id="family">Family</h2>
        <p>As a professional athlete, you should continue to strive to maintain positive relationships with your
            family members by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting aside a specific day and time each week to talk to your family by phone</li>
            <li>Communicating regularly via e-mail or text messaging</li>
            <li>Attending special family events whenever possible</li>
            <li>Reassuring your family that they are still an important part of your life</li>
            <li>Remembering that you’re in the public eye, and always strive to make your family proud</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Whenever we do a Q&amp;A with profession-al athletes
            for our younger players, one of the most common questions we hear is, “What do you do when you have a
            bad game? How do you react?”</p>
        <p>The common denominator for the majority of the pros is that they make a separation between the game and
            their lives. After a game, they go home and spend time with their husband or boyfriend or parents or
            siblings—whatever their family situation is, they spend time with those people they love the most to
            help detach emotionally from the game.</p>
        <p>As we tell them, there is nothing we can do to change the outcome now except to look forward to
            practicing and fixing whatever didn’t go right. But they have to have that positive retreat from the
            pressure of the sport; don’t bring the negative vibe of feeling like a failure or that you let people
            down into your family space. Just knowing that until it’s time to get back on the practice field, now is
            the time to enjoy the company of family goes a long way in helping a professional play soccer at the
            highest level for a long time.</p>

        <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
        <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should have earned your degree at
            college. As a professional athlete, you should take advantage of continuing education opportunities. For
            example, some sports organizations provide signing bonuses that include money just for school. Even if
            you’re not provided with education money, you should strive to expand your mind in new and different
            ways.</p>
        <p>For example, business classes can help you later in life when you retire from sports. Taking classes just
            for fun, such as a foreign language class or an art class, can provide an opportunity to develop
            creative skills. Yoga classes can help you reduce stress and even improve your performance on the field
            of play.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> The women’s professional league draft is in December,
            so we have a lot of players who opt out of school in December to get drafted—which means they don’t
            finish their last semester of school. What many of them end up doing is to get drafted, play their
            season, but then come back to finish their last semester during the off-season.</p>
        <p>That is so important because, at the end of the day, they have invested so much time in school and they
            are so close to finishing that it would be a waste not to. Even if they get drafted, they can still go
            back and finish the degree, and we always encourage them to do so. Otherwise, what do you do if your
            career is cut short due to injury or simply when you choose to retire? You’ve got to have that degree
            for thinking about transitioning to life outside of soccer. <span

        <h2 id="social-life">Social Life</h2>
        <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should continue to maintain a supportive
            social life. Make time for your friends when you can, and always strive to be a true friend. At the same
            time, be careful who you associate with, because you will be judged by the company you keep.</p>
        <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One time, we were running a camp with Paul Burns, who
            back then was the assistant coach for Newcastle United in England, in the Premier League. He said, “What
            other element do you add to the most important elements that make a soccer player? What makes a soccer
            player is their technical ability, tactical ability, psychological and physical ability, but in the
            Premier League, one of the most important things that we look for is your lifestyle.”</p>
        <p>When players begin signing contracts and making money, they often don’t know what to do with the sudden
            fame and fortune, and their entire lifestyle changes. Their social life becomes all about going out,
            partying, having a good time—and then they end up coming to games unprepared. It affects the way they
            play, as well as their mental game.</p>
        <p>Who you choose to hang around with and how you choose to spend your time makes even more difference now
            than it did when you were in school, because now you don’t have your parents to hold you accountable or
            the fear of losing a scholarship to help you make good choices. Pick the right friends, surround
            yourself with the right people, pay attention to the older players who have learned how to find the
            balance, and that will be the key to being truly successful.</p>

        <h2 id="role-model">Role Model</h2>
        <p>These days, everyone has a cell phone with a camera. For a professional athlete—or anyone in the public
            eye—one mistake can be broadcast internationally in a matter of moments. Remember that young people are
            looking up to you. Be a good role model citizen by behaving well and by engaging in charity work and
            community service.</p>
        <p class="athlete"><span class="runin-head">Kassi McCluskie &gt;&gt;</span> Now that my profession is as a
            coach, I appreciate even more how important it is to have good role models in women’s sports. Mentoring
            is so important for both the older and younger players with whom I work. As a coach, I love having a Big
            Sister/Little Sister pairing with the teams in our club so that players at lower Levels are matched with
            players at the higher Levels. The girls are encouraged to go to one another’s games to cheer each other
            on, or to make encouragement cards and signs before big games. Unfortunately, I still don’t think there
            are enough female role models out there in the world of sports, so it is really fantastic for younger
            girls to have older girls they can watch and learn from in a personal, one-on-one manner. In the same
            way, it is a wonderful leadership learning opportunity for older players to interact with the younger
            girls and think carefully not only about how to cheer for them and work on skills, but also about how
            they talk and act. I think it is a positive experience for everyone.</p>

    <!--<br>An Overview of Soccer</h1>-->

    <!--<h3 class="runin-head">HISTORY OF SOCCER</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Soccer has a very interesting history. Believe it or not, there is evidence that a game similar to soccer was-->
    <!--played in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC! Ancient Roman and Greek warriors also played a form of-->
    <!--soccer to help them prepare for battle.</p>-->
    <!--<p>During the 8th century AD, the first soccer games were played in Britain. These games were very violent. Injury-->
    <!--and even death occurred in nearly every game. For this reason, soccer was banned in England by King Edward in-->
    <!--1365. Anyone who was caught playing soccer was thrown into prison.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Soccer was banned by many other kings and queens of England who came after King Edward. However, this did not-->
    <!--stop people from playing the game. For many centuries, there were no universally accepted rules for soccer.-->
    <!--Different forms of the game were played in different areas of Great Britain.</p>-->
    <!--<h3 class="runin-head">SOCCER RULES ESTABLISHED</h3>-->
    <!--<p>In 1863, the first-ever association for soccer was founded in England. It was called the Football Association, or-->
    <!--FA, because in Europe, soccer is called football. Representatives from schools and clubs around Great Britain-->
    <!--got together and established the first set of common rules for soccer matches.</p>-->
    <!--<p id="p279">Now that soccer had a standard set of rules, other European countries began to play the game. Many club-->
    <!--teams were formed during the late 1800s and early 1900s in countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand,-->
    <!--Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Switzerland, Italy, Uruguay, Germany, Hungary, and Finland.</p>-->
    <!--<p>In May 1904 in Paris, France, the governing body for worldwide soccer was established. It was named the <cite>Fédération-->
    <!--Internationale de Football Association,</cite> or FIFA (FEE-fah) for short. In English, it means the-->
    <!--International Federation of Association Football. FIFA is responsible for overseeing international competitions.-->
    <!--FIFA also organizes the World Cup and the Women’s World Cup.</p>-->
    <!--<h3 class="runin-head">WOMEN IN SOCCER</h3>-->
    <!--<p data-link-id="subsection.id">How long have women been playing soccer? Well, evidence shows that women played in the violent soccer games of-->
    <!--old England! However, the Football Association’s rules of 1863 established that the game was for men only.-->
    <!--Nonetheless, women in England and Scotland played in informal soccer matches through the end of the 19th century-->
    <!--and into the 20th century.</p>-->
    <!--<p>In Europe, women’s soccer leagues began around 1930, and international competitions started in the 1950s. In the-->
    <!--United States, women’s soccer was confined to gym class, informal pick-up games, and college intramural-->
    <!--competition until around the 1970s.</p>-->
    <!--<p>By 1981, there were almost 100 varsity programs established in NCAA women’s soccer, and even more club teams. By-->
    <!--2001, Division-1 women’s college soccer <a id="p280"></a>tournaments started with 64 teams, compared to only 32-->
    <!--teams for the men. Teams at UNC, UConn, Notre Dame, UCLA, and Penn State became regular contenders for the-->
    <!--national title.</p>-->
    <!--<p>After college, some of the women on the college teams became professional soccer players. They joined the United-->
    <!--States Women’s National Team (USWNT), which represents the United States of America in international soccer-->
    <!--competitions.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Today, the United States is considered the top country in the world for women’s soccer, both in terms of-->
    <!--participation and in international competition. The United States Women’s National Team has won three World-->
    <!--Cups, four Olympic gold medals, and one Olympic silver medal.</p>-->
    <!--<h3 class="runin-head">RULES OF SOCCER</h3>-->
    <!--<p>The rules of soccer are based on the 17 Laws of the Game. The laws were developed by FIFA, and are maintained by-->
    <!--the International Football Association Board (IFAB). These laws govern any professional or international match-->
    <!--played.</p>-->
    <!--<p>The 17 Laws of the Game were created to ensure fairness when people play soccer. They also govern the field of-->
    <!--play, the size of the soccer ball, and what referees are supposed to do during a game.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Following is an overview of what you need to know in order to play soccer at a beginner’s level. If you would-->
    <!--like to read the latest version of the Laws of the Game, go to FIFA’s website at www.fifa.com.</p>-->

    <!--<h3 id="p281" class="runin-head">THE SOCCER FIELD</h3>-->

    <!--<div class="illus w">-->
    <!--<img src="../Images/p244.jpg" alt="">-->
    <!--</div>-->

    <!--<p>Soccer is played on a rectangular field. The <span class="keyword">goal lines</span> on are the short sides of-->
    <!--the rectangle. The <span class="keyword">sidelines</span>, or touchlines, are on the long sides of the-->
    <!--rectangle. The goal lines and sidelines form the boundaries of the field of play.</p>-->
    <!--<p>The soccer field is divided into two halves by the <span class="keyword">halfway line</span>. The <span-->
    <!--class="keyword">center circle</span> is marked at the midpoint of the halfway line.</p>-->
    <!--<p>A <span class="keyword">goal area</span> is at each end of the field. <span-->
    <!--class="keyword">The Penalty Area</span> includes the penalty box and the goal box.</p>-->
    <!--<h3 id="p282" class="runin-head">FIELD MARKINGS</h3>-->
    <!--<p>The following areas of the soccer field must be marked:</p>-->

    <!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Touchlines/Sidelines</li>-->
    <!--<li>Goal lines and goal areas</li>-->
    <!--<li>Halfway line</li>-->
    <!--<li>Center circle</li>-->
    <!--<li>Penalty areas</li>-->
    <!--<li>Arcs and spots</li>-->
    <!--<li>Corner arcs</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->
    <!--<p>In addition, a flag post should be placed at each corner of the field. Also a <span class="keyword">Goal</span>-->
    <!--should be placed on the center of each goal line. It needs to have two goalposts and a crossbar on top.</p>-->
    <!--<h3 class="runin-head">PLAYING THE GAME</h3>-->
    <!--<p>The main objective of soccer is to score a goal with any part of the body <span class="keyword">except</span> the-->
    <!--arms and hands. A goal is scored if the ball crosses the goal line between the two goalposts and under the-->
    <!--crossbar. The side that scores the most goals wins. If both teams have the same number of goals at the end of-->
    <!--the match, it is considered a draw—even if neither of them scored a goal.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Soccer is played by two teams. Each team must have at least 7 players but no more than 11 players. A soccer match-->
    <!--lasts for 90 minutes, played in two equal halves of 45 minutes. </p>-->
    <!--<p id="p283">A <span class="keyword">kickoff</span> starts a soccer game. It also restarts the game at the second-->
    <!--half or after a goal is scored. A coin toss determines which team kicks off the ball at the beginning of the-->
    <!--match. During the kickoff, only two players are allowed inside the center circle—the one kicking and the one-->
    <!--receiving the ball.</p>-->
    <!--<p>The <span class="keyword">soccer ball is out of bounds</span> if it crosses the goal line or touchline either on-->
    <!--the ground or in air. The team that DID NOT have possession of the ball before it went out of bounds is awarded-->
    <!--a throw-in. While taking a <span class="keyword">throw-in</span>, a player must release the ball with both hands-->
    <!--simultaneously and keep both feet firmly planted on the ground.</p>-->
    <!--<p><span class="runin-head">Fouls and Penalties</span></p>-->
    <!--<p>The most common fouls in soccer are:</p>-->

    <!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Kicking, tripping, pushing, or charging another player</li>-->
    <!--<li>Hitting or attempting to hit any member of the opposite team</li>-->
    <!--<li>Using your hand on the ball (except the goalkeeper)</li>-->
    <!--<li>Using excessive force in defending an opponent</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->

    <!--<p>The <span class="keyword">referee</span> is in charge of calling fouls. He or she also strives to prevent-->
    <!--multiple fouls by the same player by using <span class="keyword">yellow and red cards.</span></p>-->
    <!--<p>A <span class="keyword">yellow card</span> is a warning. Two yellow cards are equivalent to a <span-->
    <!--class="keyword">red card.</span> A player who receives a red card is sent to the bench, and her team cannot-->
    <!--replace her. This means her teammates must continue the game with one less player.</p>-->
    <!--<p id="p284">A <span class="keyword">free kick</span> restarts a play after a foul is committed and is usually taken-->
    <!--from the spot where the foul happened. A free kick can either be <span class="keyword">direct</span>, where the-->
    <!--player may score directly, or <span class="keyword">indirect</span>, where another player must touch the ball-->
    <!--before a goal can be scored.</p>-->
    <!--<p>A <span class="keyword">penalty kick</span> is awarded to the opposite team when a player commits a foul inside-->
    <!--her team’s penalty area. The kick is taken from the penalty spot, and all the players except the kicker and the-->
    <!--goalkeeper must be outside the penalty area and penalty arc.</p>-->
    <!--<p>A <span class="keyword">goal kick</span> is awarded when the offensive team plays the ball out of bounds over the-->
    <!--defensive team’s goal line. After the ball is out of play, the defender or goalkeeper may place the ball-->
    <!--anywhere within the goal box and kick the ball back into play.</p>-->
    <!--<p>A <span class="keyword">corner kick</span> is awarded to the attacking team if an opposing player is the last to-->
    <!--touch the ball before it goes out of bounds on the goal line. The attacking team resumes play by placing the-->
    <!--ball in the corner arc nearest to where it crossed the goal line.</p>-->
