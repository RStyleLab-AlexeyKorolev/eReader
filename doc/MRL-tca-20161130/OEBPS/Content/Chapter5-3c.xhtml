<h2 id="core-strength">Core Strength</h2>
<p>You are in the best shape of your life, playing against some of the most elite players in the world, and every athlete is out to either beat you or take your jobâ€”so staying healthy can be as important as scoring a goal. This is where having a strong core can be crucial for a soccer player. You need your hips to be strong to deliver accurate, crisp passes, and your lower back needs to be able to support all the torque that comes with kicking a ball powerfully. A weakness in your core simply means you are likely going to be injured sooner rather than later.</p>
