<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<p>Whether or not a student-athlete moves into professional level play, the <span class="keyword">leadership</span> skills she has developed over the years will continue to benefit her as she leaves college. In corporate America, as on a soccer team, a strong, confident leader can inspire a team to accomplish goals that they can’t accomplish on their own. This is one of the many reasons why many companies hire former athletes.</p>
<p>A former player may consider coaching, moving up from introductory levels to higher Levels of coaching. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of coaches is expected to increase much faster than the average for all occupations through 2022. Nonetheless, there will be a lot of competition for college and professional coaching jobs.</p>
<p>The athlete who has developed strong leadership skills over the years will be a much more attractive candidate, because she will already possess the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Excellent communication skills that allow her to effectively teach and convey information to her team</li>
	<li>The ability to make quick decisions, especially during games and other high pressure situations</li>
	<li>Effective interpersonal skills that allow her to relate to her players</li>
	<li>Negotiation skills that allow her to solve problems in the best interest of everyone involved</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When you’re in that little tunnel with the opposing team lining up next to you, and the referees are right in front of you, and you are waiting for them to <!--p252-->give you the green light to step on the field because the TV is going to start, and it’s going to be live feeding, and this is when the TV had the cameras on the team in that tunnel … imagine that you are standing right across from your opponent and channel that energy into your mind, your body, your eyes, and your voice.</p>
<p>Recently, just before a big Premier League game between Arsenal and Lester on television, there were cameras on both teams and about 80,000 fans in attendance waiting for the teams to step onto the field. All the players were trying to look sharp in front of the camera and put a smile on their faces, but when that green light was given for both teams to walk on the field, Arsenal captain’s whole demeanor changed. In an instant it went from, “Yeah, we have a big game right now, lads,” to, “Come on, men, we’re going to war and we are representing all of our fans today.” It was an amazing moment to witness the leader forget about everything going on around him and shift his mind to a place where he knew he had to get his players in that state of mind. <span class="attribution">–Walid and Ziad</span></p>
<p class="athlete"><span class="keyword">Camille Levin &gt;&gt;</span> I ended up going to Europe when I first entered the pros—a lot of Americans do. I was drafted by a Swedish team, and I was fortunate because a lot of Swedes speak English very well, so it wasn’t too big of an adjustment. But it can be kind of overwhelming at first to be living in a new country and not speaking the language, trying to learn a new culture, understanding how people work there, and how things work there in general. At the end of the day, though, I was there for soccer, so when you’re on the field, it doesn’t matter where you are or where you came from. There are different play styles and different approaches, but we <!--p253-->were all there to play soccer. When I was on the field, I was confident in what I was doing and I was in my happy place. Wherever you are, at the end of the day, you’re on a soccer field with a ball and your team. It doesn’t matter what language they’re speaking or what culture differences there are—ultimately, you’re all there for the same reason. That is a pretty neat thing about the sport and how universal it is.</p>
