<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
<p>As a professional athlete, you should continue to strive to maintain positive relationships with your family members by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Setting aside a specific day and time each week to talk to your family by phone</li>
	<li>Communicating regularly via e-mail or text messaging</li>
	<li>Attending special family events whenever possible</li>
	<li>Reassuring your family that they are still an important part of your life</li>
	<li>Remembering that you’re in the public eye, and always strive to make your family proud</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Whenever we do a Q&amp;A with profession-al athletes for our younger players, one of the most common questions we hear is, “What do you do when you have a bad game? How do you react?”</p>
<p>The common denominator for the majority of the pros is that they make a separation between the game and their lives. After a game, they go home and spend time with their husband or boyfriend or parents or siblings—whatever their family situation is, they spend time with those people they love the most to help detach emotionally from the game.</p>
<p>As we tell them, there is nothing we can do to change the outcome now except to look forward to practicing and fixing whatever didn’t go right. But they have to have that positive retreat from the pressure of the sport; don’t bring the negative vibe of feeling like a failure or that you let people down into your family space. Just knowing that until it’s time to get back on the practice field, now is the time to enjoy the company of family goes a long way in helping a professional play soccer at the highest level for a long time.</p>
