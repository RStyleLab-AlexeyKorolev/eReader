<h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num">5.1</span> attitude</h1>

<p>A positive <span class="caps">attitude</span> is essential to any athlete’s success both on and off the playing field. A Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> makes a habit of demonstrating the following five attributes:</p>
<p class="toc"><a href="#respect">RESPECT</a></p>
<p class="toc"><a href="#sportsmanship">SPORTSMANSHIP</a></p>
<p class="toc"><a href="#teamwork">TEAMWORK</a></p>
<p class="toc"><a href="#professionalism">PROFESSIONALISM</a></p>
<p class="toc"><a href="#leadership">LEADERSHIP</a></p>

<!--p247-->
<h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>

<p>As a Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you must continue to demonstrate respect for your coaches and game officials, your teammates and opponents, as well as yourself. As a professional soccer player, you should also demonstrate respect for the fans who come to see you and your team play. If someone asks for your autograph, be gracious and friendly. Remember, without the fans, you might not have a team to play on.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At the pro level right now, you’re going to start having fans follow you on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram—and come to your games. You’ve got to show a lot of respect for those fans.</p>
<p>At the Super Cup in Sweden, you can see the players hugging fans afterward and just spending a great deal of time with them following the game. It is so moving to see little girls absolutely glowing as they get autographs from their favorite heroines. As a coach, it makes you proud to see your players making such a connection with the fans and as a fan; that moment of genuine engagement can mean so, so much.</p>
<p>Don’t ever take your fans for granted and don’t ever think you are above meeting them, snapping photos, or shaking hands. Your supporters are a huge part of who you are as a player.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When Christen Press got drafted in the first round and had to share the front position with Abby Wambach, we talked about how important it was for her to give respect to the senior players who have paid their dues. The reason why she’s playing at the level <!--p248-->she is, is because these players paved the way for her. It is tremendously important when a rookie comes into a team that she gives the respect to the veteran players because of their experience and the ways that they can guide younger players on and off the field. It could be the turning point in a player growing as an athlete by being willing to be mentored. –Ziad</p>


<h2 id="sportsmanship">Sportsmanship</h2>

<p><span class="caps">Good Sportsmanship</span> starts with respect for one’s teammates, opponents, coaches, and officials. A Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> demonstrates good sportsmanship by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Playing by the rules and never cheating</li>
	<li>Acknowledging and encouraging her teammates</li>
	<li>Accepting responsibility for her own mistakes</li>
	<li>Never arguing with the officials</li>
	<li>Winning and losing with grace</li>
</ul>
<p>As a professional soccer player, you must always remember that you are not the only player on the team. Even if you’re a star player, you can’t win a game all by yourself. Demonstrate good sportsmanship by giving credit to your teammates and your coaches when you win a game. You should also acknowledge that the other team was a formidable opponent.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One of the best examples of sportsman-ship at the professional level was the Women’s World Cup final between Japan and the United States. It was supposed to be a great matchup, but the game was over by halftime with a score of 4-1. What was so amazing, <!--p249-->though, was that the Japanese team never argued with the referees or with one another. They stayed respectful and they continued to encourage one another as a team. After the game, they shook hands and didn’t act angry. They were being watched by their country and by the whole world, and they absolutely shone in terms of what real sportsmanship looks like. They were an example for every team, every player, and every coach to learn from. It was amazing to watch. –Walid and Ziad</p>


<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>

<p>A soccer player who reaches the professional ranks will likely join a team that is already a tight-knit family. She is going to need to earn the trust of her new teammates and maintain that trust using the skills she has learned up to this point.</p>

<!--p250-->
<h2 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h2>

<p>As a Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, a soccer player simply needs to be the <span class="caps">professional</span> that she is being paid to be by representing her team and her sport admirably. In addition to the list of do’s and don’ts presented in Level 4, a professional athlete must learn how to speak to the media correctly and in a way that presents her team in a good light.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At this level, every player has to understand that it’s not about the name on the back of the jersey; it’s about the name on the front of the jersey. Whenever you’re doing an interview or doing any charity work or involved in community activities, you’ve got to always remember that you’re representing a club, you’re representing your whole roster of that year, you’re representing the tradition that club set up in that community, and it’s not about you. It’s about the team.</p>
<p>It’s really important for the players to control their emotions, especially during an interview after a heart-breaking loss. Know that there are thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of people watching that interview. They are waiting for you to see what you are going to say. Are you going to blame a teammate for costing you the game, or are you going to do just the opposite? Are you going to say, “We gave it everything and today just wasn’t our day,” or are you going to start pointing fingers? Remember that every single thing you say or do at that level is representing your team, your traditions, and your community. –Ziad</p>

<!--p251-->
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>

<p>Whether or not a student-athlete moves into professional level play, the <span class="caps">leadership</span> skills she has developed over the years will continue to benefit her as she leaves college. In corporate America, as on a soccer team, a strong, confident leader can inspire a team to accomplish goals that they can’t accomplish on their own. This is one of the many reasons why many companies hire former athletes.</p>
<p>A former player may consider coaching, moving up from introductory levels to higher Levels of coaching. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of coaches is expected to increase much faster than the average for all occupations through 2022. Nonetheless, there will be a lot of competition for college and professional coaching jobs.</p>
<p>The athlete who has developed strong leadership skills over the years will be a much more attractive candidate, because she will already possess the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Excellent communication skills that allow her to effectively teach and convey information to her team</li>
	<li>The ability to make quick decisions, especially during games and other high pressure situations</li>
	<li>Effective interpersonal skills that allow her to relate to her players</li>
	<li>Negotiation skills that allow her to solve problems in the best interest of everyone involved</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When you’re in that little tunnel with the opposing team lining up next to you, and the referees are right in front of you, and you are waiting for them to <!--p252-->give you the green light to step on the field because the TV is going to start, and it’s going to be live feeding, and this is when the TV had the cameras on the team in that tunnel … imagine that you are standing right across from your opponent and channel that energy into your mind, your body, your eyes, and your voice.</p>
<p>Recently, just before a big Premier League game between Arsenal and Lester on television, there were cameras on both teams and about 80,000 fans in attendance waiting for the teams to step onto the field. All the players were trying to look sharp in front of the camera and put a smile on their faces, but when that green light was given for both teams to walk on the field, Arsenal captain’s whole demeanor changed. In an instant it went from, “Yeah, we have a big game right now, lads,” to, “Come on, men, we’re going to war and we are representing all of our fans today.” It was an amazing moment to witness the leader forget about everything going on around him and shift his mind to a place where he knew he had to get his players in that state of mind. –Walid and Ziad</p>
<p><span class="caps">Camille Levin &gt;&gt;</span> I ended up going to Europe when I first entered the pros—a lot of Americans do. I was drafted by a Swedish team, and I was fortunate because a lot of Swedes speak English very well, so it wasn’t too big of an adjustment. But it can be kind of overwhelming at first to be living in a new country and not speaking the language, trying to learn a new culture, understanding how people work there, and how things work there in general. At the end of the day, though, I was there for soccer, so when you’re on the field, it doesn’t matter where you are or where you came from. There are different play styles and different approaches, but we <!--p253-->were all there to play soccer. When I was on the field, I was confident in what I was doing and I was in my happy place. Wherever you are, at the end of the day, you’re on a soccer field with a ball and your team. It doesn’t matter what language they’re speaking or what culture differences there are—ultimately, you’re all there for the same reason. That is a pretty neat thing about the sport and how universal it is.</p>
