<h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num">5.5</span> LIFESTYLE</h1>

<p>For student-athletes who become one of the rare few who move on to the professional level in their sport, life can sometimes feel like an open book. More people are watching them play, and they are more in the public eye than ever before. A Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> is one who continues to successfully balance all the elements in her life, including:</p>

<!--p271-->
<p>As a professional athlete, you should continue to strive to maintain positive relationships with your family members by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Setting aside a specific day and time each week to talk to your family by phone</li>
	<li>Communicating regularly via e-mail or text messaging</li>
	<li>Attending special family events whenever possible</li>
	<li>Reassuring your family that they are still an important part of your life</li>
	<li>Remembering that you’re in the public eye, and always strive to make your family proud</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Whenever we do a Q&amp;A with profession-al athletes for our younger players, one of the most common questions we hear is, “What do you do when you have a bad game? How do you react?”</p>
<p>The common denominator for the majority of the pros is that they make a separation between the game and their lives. After a game, they go home and spend time with their husband or boyfriend or parents or siblings—whatever their family situation is, they spend time with those people they love the most to help detach emotionally from the game.</p>
<p>As we tell them, there is nothing we can do to change the outcome now except to look forward to practicing and fixing whatever didn’t go right. But they have to have that positive retreat from the pressure of the sport; don’t bring the negative vibe of feeling like a failure or that you let people down into your family space. Just knowing that until it’s time to get back on the practice field, now is the time to enjoy the company of family goes a long way in helping a professional play soccer at the highest level for a long time.</p>

<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>

<p>As a Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should have earned your degree at college. As a professional athlete, you should take advantage of continuing education opportunities. For example, some sports organizations provide signing bonuses that include money just for school. Even if you’re not provided with education money, you should strive to expand your mind in new and different ways.</p>
<p>For example, business classes can help you later in life when you retire from sports. Taking classes just for fun, such as a foreign language class or an art class, can provide an opportunity to develop creative skills. Yoga classes can help you reduce stress and even improve your performance on the field of play.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> The women’s professional league draft is in December, so we have a lot of players who opt out of school in December to get drafted—which means they don’t finish their last semester of school. What many of them end up doing is to get drafted, play their season, but then come back to finish their last semester during the off-season.</p>
<p>That is so important because, at the end of the day, they have invested so much time in school and they are so close to finishing that it would be a waste not to. Even if they get drafted, they can still go back and finish the degree, and we always encourage them to do so. Otherwise, what do you do if your career is cut short due to injury or simply when you choose to retire? You’ve got to have that degree for thinking about transitioning to life outside of soccer. –Walid and Ziad</p>

<h2 id="social-life">Social Life</h2>

<p>As a Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should continue to maintain a supportive social life. Make time for your friends when you can, and always strive to be a true friend. At the same time, be careful who you associate with, because you will be judged by the company you keep.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One time, we were running a camp with Paul Burns, who back then was the assistant coach for Newcastle United in England, in the Premier League. He said, “What other element do you add to the most important elements that make a soccer player? What makes a soccer player is their technical ability, tactical ability, psychological and physical ability, but in the Premier League, one of the most important things that we look for is your lifestyle.”</p>
<p>When players begin signing contracts and making money, they often don’t know what to do with the sudden fame and fortune, and their entire lifestyle changes. Their social life becomes all about going out, partying, having a good time—and then they end up coming to games unprepared. It affects the way they play, as well as their mental game.</p>
<p>Who you choose to hang around with and how you choose to spend your time makes even more difference now than it did when you were in school, because now you don’t have your parents to hold you accountable or the fear of losing a scholarship to help you make good choices. Pick the right friends, surround yourself with the right people, pay attention to the older players who have learned how to find the balance, and that will be the key to being truly successful.</p>

<h2 id="role-model">Role Model</h2>

<p>These days, everyone has a cell phone with a camera. For a professional athlete—or anyone in the public eye—one mistake can be broadcast internationally in a matter of moments. Remember that young people are looking up to you. Be a good role model citizen by behaving well and by engaging in charity work and community service.</p>
<p><span class="caps yellow">Kassi McCluskie &gt;&gt;</span> Now that my profession is as a coach, I appreciate even more how important it is to have good role models in women’s sports. Mentoring is so important for both the older and younger players with whom I work. As a coach, I love having a Big Sister/Little Sister pairing with the teams in our club so that players at lower Levels are matched with players at the higher Levels. The girls are encouraged to go to one another’s games to cheer each other on, or to make encouragement cards and signs before big games. Unfortunately, I still don’t think there are enough female role models out there in the world of sports, so it is really fantastic for younger girls to have older girls they can watch and learn from in a personal, one-on-one manner. In the same way, it is a wonderful leadership learning opportunity for older players to interact with the younger girls and think carefully not only about how to cheer for them and work on skills, but also about how they talk and act. I think it is a positive experience for everyone.</p>
