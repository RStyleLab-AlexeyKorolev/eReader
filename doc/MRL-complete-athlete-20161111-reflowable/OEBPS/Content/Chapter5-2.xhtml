<h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num">5.2</span> PREPARATION</h1>
<p><span class="caps">Preparation</span> refers to off-the-field activities, such as practicing skills, eating right, staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and mentally preparing for a game or practice. A <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> prepares to perform on the field of play by continuously improving on the following:</p>

<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>

<p>If you have become a Level 5<span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you may already be playing soccer professionally. Like at Level 4, practice sessions will be supervised by an elite coaching staff. Nonetheless, a professional soccer player takes full responsibility for training and practicing safely, both independently as well as with the team. She knows her body well enough to know how to push her-self while at the same time minimizing the risk of injury. After all, an injured player can’t play at her full potential.</p>
<p>A Level 5 <span class="caps">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> continues to practice those skills she has already mastered—including the basics. In addition, she develops and practices new and innovative skills that can provide a competitive advantage for her team.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> I was stuck in Chicago O’Hare with a connecting-flight delay that wouldn’t leave until late the next day, so I called my friend Rory Damos, coach of the Chicago Red Stars. He came and picked me up and invited me to watch the team practice, so I did. Afterward, I noticed two players who stayed afterward doing extra shots: Julie Johnston and Christen Press, both of whom had just played in the World Cup. They were probably the two players who least needed to stay after for extra work, but there they were, fresh off of winning the World Cup. Even now, at the highest point of their careers, they were still putting in the extra time—which is the reason they reached such a high level in the first place.</p>
<p>I coached Christen Press from the time she was at Level 1 all the way through, and she always showed up early or stayed late to take shots. That’s the reason she broke <!--p256-->the record for Stanford for the most goals scored ever in Stanford history. That’s why she already has 31 goals for the U.S. National Team. It goes to show you how important practice is and how it is even more important to put your own time into practices after your official practice is done. –Walid</p>


<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>

<p>As a college student-athlete moves on to professional sports, <span class="caps">Nutrition</span> continues to play a key role, not only for optimal performance on the field of play, but also for optimal health throughout her life.</p>

<h3>Level 5 athlete nutrition guidelines &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Each individual has different macronutrient needs, based on height, weight, age, activity level, and genetic background. The following macronutrient guidelines are based on age and estimated activity level for a Level 5 athlete:</p>
<ul>
	<li>45% carbohydrate</li>
	<li>35% protein</li>
	<li>20% fat</li>
	<li>No more than 7% saturated fat</li>
	<li>No trans fat</li>
	<li>38-40 grams of fiber per day</li>
	<li>No more than 150 calories per day from sugar (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> As a professional, the way you take care of yourself says everything about you. The more you put the right food in your body and stay in playing condition, <!--p257-->the more longevity and fewer injuries you’re going to have as an athlete. It tells coaches what kind of shape you are in when you come in the preseason. Among the really great players, the common denominator is that they always take care of themselves in the off-season. They get up in the morning and work out on their own or with other players from the team, or they even hire their own conditioning coaches and nutritionists. They take care of themselves because they know how important it is for them when they show up to that first practice, to that first preseason camp. The biggest indicator to their coaches of where they are at, their commitment to their team, and how promising their future is, is what kind of care those athletes take of their bodies in the off-season.</p>


<h2 id="hydration">Hydration</h2>

<p>All athletes should drink water before, during, and after practices and games.*</p>

<h3>HOW TO MAINTAIN PROPER HYDRATION*&gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Before exercise, drink 16-20 full ounces within</li>
	<li>the two-hour period prior to exercise.</li>
	<li>During exercise, drink 4-6 full ounces.</li>
	<li>After exercise, replace 24 full ounces for every</li>
	<li>one pound of body weight lost during exercise.</li>
	<li>Adapted from guidelines provided by the</li>
	<li>American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)</li>
</ul>

<!--p258-->
<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>

<p>A Level 5 athlete needs to eat and drink within 30 minutes of a practice or game to make up for the calories they are burning and fluids they are using. Replenishing calories and fluids also aids in muscle recovery and repair.</p>

<h3>How to replenish calories and fluids &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Drink 24 ounces of fluid for every pound of sweat lost</p>
<p>within a two-hour period of a game or practice.</p>
<p>Consume 30-35 grams of protein plus an equal amount</p>
<p>of carbohydrates within the 30 minute recovery window.</p>
<p><span class="caps yellow">Sleep</span> Sleep is still very important for muscle recovery and repair at this stage. Inadequate sleep will have a negative effect on athletic performance, and your body will not be able to “bounce back” as easily as it did when you were younger. According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level 5 athlete should get 7-9 hours of sleep each night.</p>

<!--p259-->
<p>Obviously, research cannot pinpoint the&#160;exact&#160;amount of sleep needed by a particular individual, which is why it’s so important to pay attention to your own individual need for rest and recovery. One way to do this is by assessing how you feel on different amounts of sleep. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you productive, healthy, and happy on seven hours of sleep? Or do you need closer to nine hours of quality sleep time to feel this way?</li>
	<li>Do you wake feeling groggy, or do you bounce out of bed ready to take on the day?</li>
	<li>Do you depend on caffeine to get you through the day?</li>
	<li>Do you feel sleepy when driving?</li>
</ul>
<p>Experimenting with different amounts of sleep time can give you a better idea of what your particular needs are for quality sleep.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Finding a work-life balance is so impor-tant for professional athletes. You see it over and over: When a team travels to another city, relatives, friends, and former teammates come out to meet the players. They want to grab dinner, grab a drink, catch up—and that is wonderful! But a professional also needs to know when to say, “Thank you! It was great seeing you, but it’s time for me to go now. I need to sleep before tomorrow.” A common denominator among great athletes is the strength to know when to say good-bye to well-intentioned visitors, because a lack of sleep is cumu-lative, and when it happens in city after city that people want to hang out, it can really wear on a person who is trying to balance their social life and the professional life where they get paid to do what they love.</p>

<h2 id="mentality">Mentality</h2>

<p>Being a better athlete does not necessarily mean training harder or longer. Certainly a youth soccer player must spend time physically preparing her body to meet the demands of a practice session or game. Similarly, engaging in <span class="caps">Mental Preparation</span> can help her perform at a higher level by creating the proper mindset for either practice or a game.</p>
<p>At Level 5, focus remains an important part of mental preparedness. More and more elite athletes and sports programs are incorporating mindfulness, meditation, and other practices into their training regimen. Accor-ding to Kristen Race, Ph.D., an expert on brain-based mindfulness solutions, “Mindfulness helps train the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that creates a calm and alert state of mind, which helps us stay focused, avoid distraction, and perform at our best.”</p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness is not easy, but like everything else in sports, the more you do it, the better you get at it. Dr. Race suggests the following tips for practicing mindfulness:</p>
<p><span class="caps yellow">Engage in mindful breathing</span> every morning as well as before a game or practice to create a calm and clear state of mind. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and start to deepen your breath. Inhale fully and exhale completely. Focus on your breath entering and exiting your body. Start with five minutes and build up from there.</p>
<p><span class="caps yellow">Conduct a body scan,</span> which can release tension, quiet the mind, and bring awareness to your body in a <!--p261-->systematic way. Lie down on your back, with your palms facing up and legs relaxed. Close your eyes. Start with your toes and notice how they feel. Are they tense? Are they warm or cold? Focus your attention here for a few breaths before moving on to the sole of your foot. Repeat the process as you travel from your foot to your ankle, calf, knee, and thigh. Bring your attention to your other foot and repeat the process.</p>
<p>Continue to move up to your hips, lower back, stomach, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, and head—maintaining your focus on each body part and any sensations there. Breathe into any areas that are holding stress and try to release it.</p>
<p><span class="caps yellow">Pay attention to your internal dialogue,</span> which can reflect—or even shape—your mental state. Instead of thinking, “I hope I don’t miss the goal,” speak in terms of what you want to achieve; for example, “I’m going to score a point today.”</p>
<p><span class="caps">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When Christen Press joined the national team, she began relying on meditation to help ready her mind to play. Her sister had attended Villanova and began to practice meditation there; she shared the techniques with Christen, and they became an impor-tant part of her preparation before each game. Christen has stated in interviews that she believes this conscious mindfulness gives her an edge to give her the mentality to be strong and focused for big-stage games, like the Olympics qualifiers, the World Cup qualifiers, and playing in World Cup matches.</p>
