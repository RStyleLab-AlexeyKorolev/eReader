<h1 class="sec-header"><span class="sec-num">5.3</span> Fitness</h1>

<p>Level 5 is the highest Level of soccer. At this level, your own dedication to fitness will not only make you stronger than your opponents, but also more flexible, more explosive, faster, and healthier.</p>
<p>All of the exercises and tests below have been described in earlier sections. Your goal is to compete against your previous scores and always strive to improve.</p>

<h2 id="lower-body-strength">Lower Body STRENGTH</h2>

<p>At Level 5, as a professional, you are at the top of your game physically; you are stronger, more explosive, healthier, and better balanced than ever before. You are staying fit during crucial practices, getting more reps because of it, and seeing the difference on the pitch. If you keep your fitness and health during practice and games, it may be the difference to making a higher salary or being chosen to play for a national team. Stronger legs have made you faster to the point of contact, and you are now out-jumping your opponent for free balls in the air or winning slide tackles. Single-leg squats are easier, your balance is top-notch, and your jumping is exceptionally high. Congrats you are ready for Level 5 testing and dominating any challenge!</p>

<p>You may now be playing against players 5-10 years older than you. You may be just as skilled, but are you just as strong? National coaches will be looking at you to separate yourself from competition, so the margin for error is minuscule. At this level, decisions may come down to matchups with other teams just as skilled, so skill may not be what is most important at some positions. You don’t want to be on the bench due to your lack of strength!</p>

<h2 id="core-strength">Core Strength</h2>

<p>You are in the best shape of your life, playing against some of the most elite players in the world, and every athlete is out to either beat you or take your job—so staying healthy can be as important as scoring a goal. This is where having a strong core can be crucial for a soccer player. You need your hips to be strong to deliver accurate, crisp passes, and your lower back needs to be able to support all the torque that comes with kicking a ball powerfully. A weakness in your core simply means you are likely going to be injured sooner rather than later.</p>
