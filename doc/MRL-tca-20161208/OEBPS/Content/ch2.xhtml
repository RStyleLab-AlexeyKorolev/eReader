	<h1>IN LEVEL 2</h1>
	<p>a soccer player is starting to develop her own person- ality on and off the field. Foundational skills are being refined with dedicated practice and new skills are being learned. Off the field, you begin to understand how attitude, preparation, and lifestyle can play a role in preparing you for higher levels. Mastering this level isnâ€™t just for athletes, though; coaches and parents will learn how to support athletes and appre-ciate the importance of balancing their involvement in encouraging their daughters to reach their full potential.</p>
