<h2>NUTRITION</h2>

<p><span class="keyword heading">NUTRITION</span> plays a key role in athletic performance. Youth athletes are building muscle, burning calories, and growing. They need to eat and drink regularly to make up for the loss of calories they are burning and the fluids they are using during practice and actual games.</p>
<p>An active youth soccer player needs to consume healthy food and beverages in order to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Replenish her energy supply</li>
	<li>Maintain hydration</li>
	<li>Obtain the vitamins and minerals needed to support metabolism, tissue growth, and repair </li>
	<li>Prevent injuries and/or illnesses</li>
	<li>Perform at her best both on and off the field</li>
</ul>


<p id="p38"><span class="keyword">NOTE &gt;&gt;</span> All of <cite>The Complete Athlete</cite> sports nutrition guidelines were provided by Courtney M. Sullivan, founder of Nutrition for Body and Mind. Sullivan is a Registered Dietitian certified by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and a Certified Personal Trainer recognized by the National Academy of Sports Medicine. Appendix 2 provides more detailed guidelines as well as suggested meals and recipes developed by Sullivan.</p>


<h3>GENERAL SPORTS NUTRITION GUIDELINES &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All athletes should consume 5 or more balanced meals spread throughout the day, every 3–4 hours. </li>
	<li>Meals should be eaten 2–3 hours before practice or games, and snacks eaten 1–1 ½ hours before practice or games.</li>
	<li>Eat when you’re hungry to prevent lean-muscle breakdown; stop when you’re full to prevent being sluggish. </li>
	<li>Eat breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up to prevent lean-muscle breakdown, increase energy and concentration, and maintain good blood-sugar control. Choose whole grains, fresh fruit, and lean protein for breakfast.</li>
	<li>Eat well-balanced meals and snacks, consisting of carbohydrates, lean proteins, and heart-healthy fats.</li>
	<li>Drink a protein shake or eat a snack or meal that has equal amounts of protein and carbohydrates within 30 minutes after a workout.</li>
	<li>Choose fresh, whole foods when possible (instead of processed foods that are packaged or refined) to increase nutritional value. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and/or trans fats.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="p40">LEVEL-1 ATHLETE NUTRITION GUIDELINES &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Each individual has different macronutrient needs, based on height, weight, age, activity level, and genetic background. The following macronutrient guidelines are based on age and estimated activity level for a Level-1 athlete:</p>

<ul>
	<li>60% carbohydrate</li>
	<li>15% protein</li>
	<li>25% fat</li>
	<li>No more than 7% saturated fat </li>
	<li>No trans fat </li>
	<li>25 grams of fiber per day</li>
	<li>No more than 150 calories per day from sugar (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons)</li>
</ul>

<p>To fulfill the macronutrient needs listed above, choose from the following:</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Carbohydrates</span> <span class="keyword"></span> High fiber foods, such as whole-grain bread, brown rice, whole-grain pasta (or gluten-free versions), beans, starchy vegetables (e.g., corn, peas, potatoes), quinoa, and cereal</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Proteins</span> Chicken, turkey, or fish, especially wild sal-mon, tuna, trout, mackerel, and sardines, which are high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Fats</span> Low-fat cheese, nuts/nut butters (natural peanut butter or almond butter), avocado, seeds, and heart-healthy oils like extra-virgin olive oil, canola oil, grape-seed oil, and flaxseed oil</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Vegetables</span> Preferably leafy green vegetables</p>

<p><span class="keyword heading">PARENTS &gt;&gt;</span> In tournaments, teams may have two games in a day with lunch in between. Parents will often take the kids to the closest place to eat, which is usually some kind of fast food. When they come back for the second game, they can barely even run—and it’s not because they are tired or sore from the first game; it’s because they are weighed down by greasy, trashy food!</p>
<p>You, as the parent, are the one who is driving them at this age, so you are the one who ultimately has the power to decide where you point the car. You are in charge, so you need to be willing to make healthy choices; pack a healthy lunch or go to Subway. Bring Gatorade and healthy snacks for between games for your child to eat right after their first game so they are ready to play the next one. It’s very important. You are investing a whole day; your kid is going to be there a whole day. Be prepared. Nutrition for an athlete is fuel for a car. It doesn’t matter how good the car is—if it doesn’t have gas in it, you can’t drive it. We want to establish good habits as young as possible so that the children will follow through when they get older. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
