<h2 id="p105">MENTALITY</h2>

<p>Being a better athlete does not necessarily mean training harder or longer. Certainly a youth soccer player must spend time physically preparing her body to meet the demands of a practice session or game. Similarly, engaging in <span class="keyword">Mental Preparation</span> can help her per-form at a higher level by creating the proper mindset for either practice or a game.</p>
<p>At Level 1, a youth soccer player mentally prepares by closing her eyes, breathing deeply, and envisioning her-self having fun on the soccer field. This is also a great activity to practice at Level 2. In addition, a youth soccer player should engage in activities that help her build confidence in her own abilities and that push her to higher levels of performance.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BUILD CONFIDENCE &gt;&gt;</h3>


<ul>
	<li>Reflect on all the positive feedback you’ve gotten from your coaches.</li>
	<li>Tell yourself that you’re a great player and a solid member of the team.</li>
	<li>Think about the constructive feedback you’ve gotten and remind yourself that those people really want to see you succeed.</li>
	<li>Disregard any negative comments (even if they’re from your parents) and focus only on the positive comments.</li>
	<li>Don’t beat yourself up when you make a mistake; instead, focus on doing better the next time.</li>
	<li>Continue to practice on your own. When you complete a successful practice session, your confidence rises. The more you practice, the higher your confidence will be.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p106"><span class="keyword heading">COACHES &gt;&gt;</span> If I see that my team is all over the place in practice and the focus is not there, something I have found that works really well is to stop and have everyone lie down. I tell them, “Just lie on your back, and for the next two minutes, I want you to start visualizing what we are doing and what you can do to make it better.” You can see an instant change in practice once they get up. It is a way to pull their mentality back to where it needs to be. As a coach, if you see that the mentality is not there, you need to harness the team back so that they can function as a unit. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Every player is different in terms of how she mentally prepares for games. I had one player who, before every game, needed four minutes to lie down and simply focus on the game. Another player liked to take a couple of laps around the field on her own in order to gather her thoughts. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
