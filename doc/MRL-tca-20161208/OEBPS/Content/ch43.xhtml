<p>At Level 4, a soccer player is at the college level. She likely has a strength-and-conditioning coach who super-vises fitness workouts. However, because that coach is working with an entire team of soccer players, he or she will be limited in the time spent with each individual athlete. In addition, at NCAA colleges and universities, rules are in place to limit the amount of practice and conditioning time required by and supervised by the coaches.</p>
<p>Student-athletes who want to achieve higher levels of <span class="keyword">fitness</span>—or even just want to maintain the level of fitness they’ve already achieved—must perform conditioning activities independently or alongside teammates with-out the direct supervision of the coaches. Not only does this help to establish a foundation of good fitness, but it also teaches good habits needed for success in higher levels of soccer.</p>
