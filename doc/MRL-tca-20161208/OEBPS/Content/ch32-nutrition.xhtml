<h2 id="p151">NUTRITION</h2>

<p>As a youth soccer player enters high school, <span class="keyword">Nutrition</span> continues to play a key role in her life. Nutrition is important not only for optimal performance on the field of play, but also to obtain the vitamins and minerals she needs for optimal health.</p>

<h3>LEVEL-3 ATHLETE NUTRITION GUIDELINES &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Each individual has different macronutrient needs, based on height, weight, age, activity level, and genetic background. The following macronutrient guidelines are based on age and estimated activity level for a Level-3 athlete:</p>

<ul>
	<li>50% carbohydrate</li>
	<li>25% protein</li>
	<li>25% fat</li>
	<li>No more than 7% saturated fat</li>
	<li>No trans fat</li>
	<li>38 grams of fiber per day</li>
	<li>No more than 150 calories per day from sugar (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons) </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword heading">COACHES &gt;&gt;</span> When athletes get into high school, nu-trition continues to play a key role. When I was coaching for Newport Harbor High School, I noticed a huge difference in the energy level of the kids practicing right after school and playing games on weeknights, as opposed to the club schedule, where practice was in the evening and games were on weekends. I was so confused, because it seemed like the Newport Harbor athletes were not playing nearly to their best level. When I asked them about their eating habits, it all made sense. <a id="p152"/>They were having junk-food lunches during the day, and this was the last meal they ate before practice or games after school. I stressed to them that they had to give their bodies the fuel necessary to power them through practice and games.</p>
<p>Coaches need to continually remind players that it is vitally important to put the right nutrition in their bodies for them to have that great performance. Athletes at Level 3 need to start thinking about nutrition as an element in the overall plan to grow stronger and faster. <span class="attribution">â€”Ziad</span></p>
