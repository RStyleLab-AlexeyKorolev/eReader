<h2 id="p202">PROFESSIONALISM</h2>

<p>As a youth soccer player becomes a student-athlete, <span class="keyword">professionalism</span> takes on a new meaning. She now plays for a college team, and she needs to represent that team with dignity and pride—both on and off the field, as well as on- and offline. Not doing so can have serious consequences in terms of any scholarships she may have received.</p>
<p>A student-athlete should always maintain professionalism in terms of her appearance, her attitude, and her actions. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Learning rules of etiquette and always displaying good manners</li>
	<li>Dressing appropriately off the field—no obscene T-shirts, no skimpy clothing, etc.</li>
	<li>Wearing team apparel that represents her college or university, not another one</li>
	<li>Keeping her online presence uncontroversial</li>
	<li>Staying away from inappropriate situations, such as parties where drugs may be present</li>
	<li>Avoiding the bar scene, especially if she is underage</li>
</ul>
