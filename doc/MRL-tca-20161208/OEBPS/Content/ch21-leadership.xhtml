<h2 id="p94">LEADERSHIP</h2>

<p>A good <span class="keyword">leader</span> is able to inspire and motivate others to do things they would not normally do, or to perform better than they would on their own. Developing leader-ship skills can benefit a youth athlete not only in high school and college, but also in her professional life.</p>
<p>At Level 1, a youth soccer player begins to develop an understanding of what it takes to be an effective leader by watching how her coaches inspire and motivate her and her teammates. At Level 2, she can begin to display some of the leadership skills she has observed by looking out for and encouraging the less talented players on the team. For instance, she may invite a less talented player to work with her outside of a regular practice session.</p>
<p class="athlete"><span class="keyword heading">CAMILLE LEVIN &gt;&gt;</span> Confidence can be a real struggle for preteen and teenage girls, but for me, confidence came from being on the soccer field. That has always been my happy place—whatever else is going on, that was my happy place. I think it’s part of why I thrived on the field, because I was always enjoying myself. If I had ever stopped feeling that way, I would have stopped playing. It has always been about the happiness for me, not the money (because there really isn’t much!) or the fame or some crazy lifestyle. Sure, I’ve gotten to see and experience some incredible things and I’ve met some amazing people all because of soccer, but at the end of the day, I am playing because I love the sport. I think if I had ever found myself consistently dreading it rather than loving it, I would have walked away. And someday, when joy is no longer the dominant emotion I feel when playing soccer, I will know that it is time to move on.</p>
