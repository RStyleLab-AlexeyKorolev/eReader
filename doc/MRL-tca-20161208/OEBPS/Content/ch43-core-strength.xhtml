<h2 id="p224">CORE STRENGTH </h2>

<p>Now that you are in an exclusive group of athletic achievement, the slightest differentiations can give you a major edge. An athlete who has better balance and stability will have the advantage over one who doesn’t, and this is exactly what a strong core gives you. We are keeping the plank, medicine-ball throw, hip-lift march, and side plank to your test.</p>
<p>The plank and the side plank are great exercises for strengthening your core.</p>


<h3>TO PERFORM A PLANK &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Get down on the floor with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your arms straight and supporting your weight.</li>
	<li>Make sure your body stays straight—your hips shouldn’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging.</li>
	<li>Hold this position for as long as you can.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="p225">TO PERFORM A SIDE PLANK &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Lie on your side with your legs straight.</p>
<p>Prop your upper body up on your elbow and forearm. Make sure your elbow is aligned with your shoulder.</p>
<p>Brace your core by contracting your abs forcefully and then raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your ankles to your shoulders.</p>
<p>Breathe deeply while holding this position.</p>
<p>Repeat this exercise on your other side.</p>
<p>The hip-lift march helps to measure—and improve—the strength and endurance of your back muscles.</p>

<h3>TO PERFORM A HIP-LIFT MARCH &gt;&gt;</h3>


<ul>
	<li>Lie flat on your back with your knees bent 90 degrees and your feet flat on the ground.</li>
	<li>Lift your hips as high as possible, with only your shoulders and feet touching the ground.</li>
	<li>While keeping your hips at the same height, lift each knee in a controlled marching motion for as long as possible.</li>
</ul>
