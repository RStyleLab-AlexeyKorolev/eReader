<h2 id="p163">UPPER-BODY STRENGTH</h2>



<p>Girls are older and players are getting stronger. You need to stay ahead of the curve to make sure you can win balls and keep from getting bounced off better and stronger opponents. In order to do well at these tests and to keep seeing improvement, you need to get in the weight room and put emphasis on upper-body exercises. In the highly competitive levels like high school and club ball, girls will be more aggressive; having that extra strength in your upper body will allow you to absorb contact better and not lose balanceâ€”or worse, lose the ball!</p>
