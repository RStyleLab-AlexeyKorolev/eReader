<h2 id="p143">PROFESSIONALISM</h2>

<p>Certainly a youth athlete is not a professional in the sense of being paid to play. However, developing the attitude and behaviors of a <span class="keyword">Professional</span> can help her more easily move up through the levels.</p>
<p>At Level 2, a youth soccer player begins to take responsibility for keeping her uniform and equipment clean and well maintained, for maintaining her personal hygiene, and for arriving at practices and games well groomed and ready to go to work.</p>
<p>At Level 3, this responsibility takes on even more importance as college recruiters visit her high school to watch her team play. Players who display a professional appearance and demeanor will definitely make a good impression on recruiters.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One day, the Cal Berkeley coach called me to say he had his eye on a few players and wanted to watch them practice. I told him our practice started at 6:00 but that I show up at 5:30, so he could meet me then and we could talk before practice got started. At 5:30, I arrived and he arrived … and by 5:35, nearly every player was there, too, working on juggling or shooting or passing the ball around. At 6:00 sharp, the girls started warming up together. Every single one of them was dressed exactly how she should be, in her warm-up shirt, socks, and shoes. They were just ready to go.</p>
<p>The coach looked at me in surprise and said, “You told me practice starts at 6:00. Do they show up like this all the time?”</p>
<p id="p144">“Yes,” I said. “The whole team shows up 20–30 minutes early, and they work on stuff on their own. At 6:00, we start practicing together.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m talking about!” he said. “Those are the types of kids I want in my program. Those are the types of kids I can win with. They look like a professional team—they act like a professional team!” I smiled at him and said, “We are a professional team. We just happen to be 15 or 16 years old.” <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
