<h2 id="p200">TEAMWORK</h2>

<p><span class="keyword heading">TEAMWORK</span> means working together as a group in order to achieve a goal. In sports, players contribute their individual skills and efforts in cooperation with their teammates to win games. Learning to play as part of a team, and not just as an individual athlete, is important at every level of play.</p>
<p>By Level 4, a soccer player has dedicated a great deal of her time and energy to get to this point, and she has a right to be proud of her accomplishment. So do her teammates.</p>
<p>At this stage, each member of the team has reached an elite level of play. Soccer is no longer just a game; your team might be playing for a championship at some point. Teammates need to commit to each other to the point of feeling like they are part of a family all working toward a common goal.</p>
<p>It almost feels like an earlier level at which the members of the team needed to learn to trust each other in order to work together as an effective team. Team-building exercises should be taken very seriously, and any personality issues must be worked out immediately.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Something that trips up a lot of players when they move into the collegiate level is that, for the first time in their soccer career, it’s not a year-round club. Because of the NCAA rules, there are four or five months when the coaches cannot be involved with you or have any official practices. That’s where the teamwork has to come in.</p>
<p id="p201">It is especially important for incoming freshmen that they don’t waste that four-month gap. Use it to train independent of the coach—but work as if the coach were watching! In the top programs, like Florida State and North Carolina, you see the whole team working out together in the morning. They do pick-up games at night, finding indoor arenas to play five-on-five. This is the only way that these players are going to stay sharp, compete at the highest levels, and be able to contribute to their team’s success. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
