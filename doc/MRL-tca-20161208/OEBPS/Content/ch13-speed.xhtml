<h2 id="p55">SPEED/QUICKNESS/ENDURANCE</h2>


<h3>THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SOCCER SPEED &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Straightaway speed on an open field</li>
	<li>Lateral (side-to-side) quickness </li>
</ul>

<p>The 30-yard sprint helps an athlete improve straightaway <span class="keyword">speed</span>. The 5-10-5 Shuttle Run, or Pro Agility Drill, is a great way to improve lateral <span class="keyword">quickness</span>, because it helps to hone an athlete’s ability to accelerate, decelerate, stop, and reaccelerate without losing balance. The Beep Test is a good way to measure and improve <span class="keyword">endurance</span>.</p>

<h3>TO PERFORM A 30-YARD SPRINT &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Place two cones 30 yards apart.</li>
	<li>Starting at one cone, run as fast as you can to the other cone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>TO PERFORM A 5-10-5 SHUTTLE RUN &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Set up three marker cones five yards apart. </li>
	<li>Start at the middle marker cone in a three-point stance. </li>
	<li>Turn and run five yards to the right side and touch the marker cone with your right hand. </li>
	<li>Turn around and run 10 yards to the left and touch the marker cone with your left hand.</li>
	<li>Turn and finish by running back to the middle marker cone. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="p56">TO PERFORM A BEEP TEST &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p><span class="keyword heading">NOTE &gt;&gt;</span> You’ll first need to download a beep test audio recording or beep test app, which will play beeps at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between each successive beep reduces, forcing the athlete to increase her speed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Draw two lines 20 yards apart. </li>
	<li>Stand behind one of the lines, facing the second line and begin running when instructed by the recording. </li>
	<li>Continue running between the two lines, turning when signaled by the recorded beeps. After about one minute, a sound indicates an increase in speed, and the beeps will be closer together. </li>
	<li>The test is stopped when the athlete can no longer keep in sync with the recording.</li>
</ul>
