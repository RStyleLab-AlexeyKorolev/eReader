<h1 id="p278">Appendix 1:
<br/>An Overview of Soccer</h1>

<h3 class="runin-head">HISTORY OF SOCCER</h3>
<p>Soccer has a very interesting history. Believe it or not, there is evidence that a game similar to soccer was played in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC! Ancient Roman and Greek warriors also played a form of soccer to help them prepare for battle.</p>
<p>During the 8th century AD, the first soccer games were played in Britain. These games were very violent. Injury and even death occurred in nearly every game. For this reason, soccer was banned in England by King Edward in 1365. Anyone who was caught playing soccer was thrown into prison.</p>
<p>Soccer was banned by many other kings and queens of England who came after King Edward. However, this did not stop people from playing the game. For many centuries, there were no universally accepted rules for soccer. Different forms of the game were played in different areas of Great Britain.</p>
<h3 class="runin-head">SOCCER RULES ESTABLISHED</h3>
<p>In 1863, the first-ever association for soccer was founded in England. It was called the Football Association, or FA, because in Europe, soccer is called football. Representatives from schools and clubs around Great Britain got together and established the first set of common rules for soccer matches.</p>
<p id="p279">Now that soccer had a standard set of rules, other European countries began to play the game. Many club teams were formed during the late 1800s and early 1900s in countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Switzerland, Italy, Uruguay, Germany, Hungary, and Finland.</p>
<p>In May 1904 in Paris, France, the governing body for worldwide soccer was established. It was named the <cite>Fédération Internationale de Football Association,</cite> or FIFA (FEE-fah) for short. In English, it means the International Federation of Association Football. FIFA is responsible for overseeing international competitions. FIFA also organizes the World Cup and the Women’s World Cup.</p>
<h3 class="runin-head">WOMEN IN SOCCER</h3>
<p>How long have women been playing soccer? Well, evidence shows that women played in the violent soccer games of old England! However, the Football Association’s rules of 1863 established that the game was for men only. Nonetheless, women in England and Scotland played in informal soccer matches through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.</p>
<p>In Europe, women’s soccer leagues began around 1930, and international competitions started in the 1950s. In the United States, women’s soccer was confined to gym class, informal pick-up games, and college intramural competition until around the 1970s.</p>
<p>By 1981, there were almost 100 varsity programs established in NCAA women’s soccer, and even more club teams. By 2001, Division-1 women’s college soccer <a id="p280"/>tournaments started with 64 teams, compared to only 32 teams for the men. Teams at UNC, UConn, Notre Dame, UCLA, and Penn State became regular contenders for the national title.</p>
<p>After college, some of the women on the college teams became professional soccer players. They joined the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT), which represents the United States of America in international soccer competitions.</p>
<p>Today, the United States is considered the top country in the world for women’s soccer, both in terms of participation and in international competition. The United States Women’s National Team has won three World Cups, four Olympic gold medals, and one Olympic silver medal.</p>
<h3 class="runin-head">RULES OF SOCCER</h3>
<p>The rules of soccer are based on the 17 Laws of the Game. The laws were developed by FIFA, and are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). These laws govern any professional or international match played.</p>
<p>The 17 Laws of the Game were created to ensure fairness when people play soccer. They also govern the field of play, the size of the soccer ball, and what referees are supposed to do during a game.</p>
<p>Following is an overview of what you need to know in order to play soccer at a beginner’s level. If you would like to read the latest version of the Laws of the Game, go to FIFA’s website at www.fifa.com.</p>

<h3 id="p281" class="runin-head">THE SOCCER FIELD</h3>

<div class="illus w">

</div>

<p>Soccer is played on a rectangular field. The <span class="keyword">goal lines</span> on are the short sides of the rectangle. The <span class="keyword">sidelines</span>, or touchlines, are on the long sides of the rectangle. The goal lines and sidelines form the boundaries of the field of play.</p>
<p>The soccer field is divided into two halves by the <span class="keyword">halfway line</span>. The <span class="keyword">center circle</span> is marked at the midpoint of the halfway line.</p>
<p>A <span class="keyword">goal area</span> is at each end of the field. <span class="keyword">The Penalty Area</span> includes the penalty box and the goal box.</p>
<h3 id="p282" class="runin-head">FIELD MARKINGS</h3>
<p>The following areas of the soccer field must be marked:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Touchlines/Sidelines</li>
	<li>Goal lines and goal areas</li>
	<li>Halfway line</li>
	<li>Center circle</li>
	<li>Penalty areas</li>
	<li>Arcs and spots</li>
	<li>Corner arcs</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a flag post should be placed at each corner of the field. Also a <span class="keyword">Goal</span> should be placed on the center of each goal line. It needs to have two goalposts and a crossbar on top.</p>
<h3 class="runin-head">PLAYING THE GAME</h3>
<p>The main objective of soccer is to score a goal with any part of the body <span class="keyword">except</span> the arms and hands. A goal is scored if the ball crosses the goal line between the two goalposts and under the crossbar. The side that scores the most goals wins. If both teams have the same number of goals at the end of the match, it is considered a draw—even if neither of them scored a goal.</p>
<p>Soccer is played by two teams. Each team must have at least 7 players but no more than 11 players. A soccer match lasts for 90 minutes, played in two equal halves of 45 minutes.&#160;</p>
<p id="p283">A <span class="keyword">kickoff</span> starts a soccer game. It also restarts the game at the second half or after a goal is scored. A coin toss determines which team kicks off the ball at the beginning of the match. During the&#160;kickoff, only two players are allowed inside the center circle—the one kicking and the one receiving the ball.</p>
<p>The <span class="keyword">soccer ball is out of bounds</span> if it crosses the goal line or touchline either on the ground or in air. The team that DID NOT have possession of the ball before it went out of bounds is awarded a throw-in. While taking a <span class="keyword">throw-in</span>, a player must release the ball with both hands simultaneously and keep both feet firmly planted on the ground.</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Fouls and Penalties</span></p>
<p>The most common fouls in soccer are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kicking, tripping, pushing, or charging another player </li>
	<li>Hitting or attempting to hit any member of the opposite team</li>
	<li>Using your hand on the ball (except the goalkeeper)</li>
	<li>Using excessive force in defending an opponent</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="keyword">referee</span> is in charge of calling fouls. He or she also strives to prevent multiple fouls by the same player by using <span class="keyword">yellow and red cards.</span></p>
<p>A <span class="keyword">yellow card</span> is a warning. Two&#160;yellow cards are equivalent to a <span class="keyword">red card.</span> A player who receives a&#160;red card is sent to the bench, and her team cannot replace her. This means her teammates must continue the game with one less player.</p>
<p id="p284">A <span class="keyword">free kick</span> restarts a play after a foul is committed and is usually taken from the spot where the foul happened. A free kick can either be <span class="keyword">direct</span>, where the player may score directly, or <span class="keyword">indirect</span>, where another player must touch the ball before a goal can be scored.</p>
<p>A <span class="keyword">penalty kick</span> is awarded to the opposite team when a player commits a foul inside her team’s penalty area. The kick is taken from the penalty spot, and all the players except the kicker and the goalkeeper must be outside the penalty area and penalty arc.</p>
<p>A <span class="keyword">goal kick</span> is awarded when the offensive team plays the ball out of bounds over the defensive team’s goal line. After the ball is out of play, the defender or goalkeeper may place the ball anywhere within the goal box and kick the ball back into play.</p>
<p>A <span class="keyword">corner kick</span> is awarded to the attacking team if an opposing player is the last to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds on the goal line. The attacking team resumes play by placing the ball in the corner arc nearest to where it crossed the goal line.</p>
