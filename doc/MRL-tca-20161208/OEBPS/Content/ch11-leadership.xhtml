<h2>LEADERSHIP</h2>

<p>A good leader is able to inspire and motivate others to do things they would not normally do, or to perform better than they would on their own. Developing leadership skills can benefit a youth athlete not only in high school and college but in their professional lives as well.</p>
<p>At Level 1, a youth soccer player is not expected to take on a leadership role. However, by watching how her coaches inspire and motivate the team, she can begin to develop an understanding of what traits an effective leader has—and what traits an ineffective leader has.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">COACHES &gt;&gt;</span> One of the things I do as a coach, especially for the younger ages around 7 to 10, is that I choose a different captain for every game. I explain that to them at the beginning of the season, and it helps teach all the players how to become leaders and to take responsibility. I explain that the captain’s job is to represent the team, to be positive on the field, to lead the team, and to speak on the team’s behalf. It is great to see the players working so hard to be the one picked <a id="p32"/>for the next game. Some coaches choose just one player for the whole season but, at that age, I really believe it is more important to help each child learn how to become a leader. We mold them by putting them in that position and giving them that chance. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
<p class="athlete"><span class="keyword heading">CAMILLE LEVIN &gt;&gt;</span> It is up to you, as a player, to be coachable. You need to be confident in what you are doing and how you play, but at the same time be open to hearing other opinions and flexible when the team needs it. I played every position on the field in youth, high school, and even in college. I think that experience made me more valuable to my team, more interesting to recruiters, and more sure of myself as an athlete. But first, I had to be willing to change positions from what I was used to, and that required me to listen to my coaches and be willing to do what the team asked of me.</p>
<p class="athlete">Keep in mind that if your coach is moving you, it is for one of two reasons: Either it is necessary so that the best 11 players can be on the field, or it’s because there is a certain situation where the coach believes your skills are going to help boost the team. Don’t let a change get into your head; instead of getting upset about it, embrace it! Your coach believes in your talent enough to try you in a new position.</p>
