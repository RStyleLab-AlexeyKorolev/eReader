<h2 id="p211">RECOVERY</h2>

<p>Youth athletes need to eat and drink within 30 minutes of a practice or game to make up for the calories they are burning and fluids they are using. Replenishing calories and fluids also aids in muscle <span class="keyword">recovery</span> and repair.</p>


<h3>HOW TO REPLENISH CALORIES AND FLUIDS &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Drink 24 ounces of fluid for every pound of sweat lost within a two-hour period of a game or practice.</li>
	<li>Consume 25–30 grams of protein plus an equal amount of carbohydrates within the 30-minute recovery window.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="runin-head">Sleep</span> Getting adequate sleep is difficult during this stage. Typically college student athletes are “burning the candle on both ends”; in other words, they’re up early in the morning and also up late in the evening.</p>
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level-4 student-athlete should get 7–9 hours of sleep each night. If you sleep six hours or less on a consistent basis, you may be setting yourself up for failure, because your body cannot perform at an optimal level. Sleep deprivation can also affect hormone regulation, which makes your body crave more sugar and refined carbohydrates for quick energy. That is the opposite of what your body needs.</p>

<h3 id="p212">TIPS FOR GETTING MORE SLEEP IN COLLEGE* &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p><span class="runin-head">Avoid stimulants,</span> such as coffee and energy drinks. If you must drink them, do so earlier in the day, and cut yourself off by noon.</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Wind down.</span> Your body needs time to shift into sleep mode, so spend the last hour before bed doing a calming activity, such as reading. Avoid using an electronic device, such as a laptop, because the particular type of light emanating from the screens of these devices is activating to the brain.</p>
<p><span class="runin-head">Practice a relaxing bedtime ritual.</span> A relax-ing, routine activity right before bedtime, conducted away from bright lights, helps separate your sleep time from activities that can cause excitement, stress, or anxiety and that can make it more difficult to fall asleep, get sound and deep sleep, or remain asleep.</p>

<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> The college season is condensed into a three-month period, which is so different from youth-level sports, which tend to go most of the year. As a result, the recovery period is greatly reduced, too.</p>
<p>One former player of ours admitted that her secret to doing so well in college play was ear plugs. “When you have roommates and parties in the dorms and you need to get to bed early,” she said, “just stick in some ear plugs or headphones with a little music, and go to sleep.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, some players try to find a balance between academics and sports by relying on Red Bull and coffee to keep them awake—but that means that <a id="p213"/>they have so much caffeine pumping through their veins that they can’t sleep when they try. It is very important to find the balance so that you can allow your body the rest and recovery it needs to keep you in peak shape. <span class="attribution">—Walid and Ziad</span></p>
