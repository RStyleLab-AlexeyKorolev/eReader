<h2>ROLE MODEL</h2>

<p>These days, everyone has a cell phone with a camera. For a professional athlete—or anyone in the public eye—one mistake can be broadcast internationally in a matter of moments. Remember that young people are looking up to you. Be a good role-model citizen by behaving well and by engaging in charity work and community service.</p>
<p class="athlete"><span class="runin-head">Kassi McCluskie &gt;&gt;</span> Now that my profession is as a coach, I appreciate even more how important it is to have good role models in women’s sports. Mentoring is so important for both the older and younger players with whom I work. As a coach, I love having a big sister/little sister pairing with the teams in our club so that players at lower levels are matched with players at the higher levels. The girls are encouraged to go to one another’s games to cheer each other on, or to make encouragement cards and signs before big games. Unfortunately, I still don’t think there are enough female role models out there in the world of sports, so it is really fantastic for younger girls to have older girls they can watch and learn from in a personal, one-on-one manner. In the same way, it is a wonderful leadership learning opportunity for older players to interact with the younger girls and think carefully not only about how to cheer for them and work on skills, but also about how they talk and act. I think it is a positive experience for everyone.</p>
