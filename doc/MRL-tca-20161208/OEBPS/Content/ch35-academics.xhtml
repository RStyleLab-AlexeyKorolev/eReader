<h2 id="p179">ACADEMICS</h2>

<p>Throughout Levels 1 and 2, a youth soccer player should have been laying the foundation for strong academic achievement. Level 3 is the time for developing plans for getting into college and earning scholarships.</p>


<h3>WHERE TO FIND ANSWERS REGARDING COLLEGE ATHLETICS &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA (www.ncaa.org), serves as the athletics governing body for more than 1,300 colleges, universities, conferences, and organizations. The organization has a wide range of resources available to help youth soccer players and their parents understand the eligibility requirements for earning scholarships and playing sports at the college level, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NCAA Guide for the College-Bound Student-Athlete, which is available as a free download from the www.ncaa.org website</li>
	<li>The NCAA Eligibility Center’s resource page on its website. Go to www.eligibilitycenter.org and click on “Resources.” </li>
	<li>www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="p180">UNDERSTANDING SCHOLARSHIPS AND ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Each NCAA Division has different scholarship oppor-tunities and eligibility requirements. For example, only NCAA Divisions-I and -II colleges and universities award athletics scholarships. Division-III colleges and universities do not award athletics scholarships, but they do provide academic scholarships as well as need-based financial aid.</p>

<h3 class="fixme green">ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY FOR A DIVISION-I COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY<a href="#note-eligibility" epub:type="noteref">*</a> &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>According to the NCAA website, to be eligible to play at a Division-I college or university, a youth soccer player must:</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">COMPLETE 16 CORE COURSES</span>, finishing at least 10 of them before the seventh semester, with at least seven of them in English, math, or natural science.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">EARN AT LEAST A 2.3 GPA IN THE CORE COURSES.</span></p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">EARN AN SAT OR ACT SCORE MATCHING YOUR CORE-COURSE GPA ON THE DIVISION-I SLIDING SCALE.</span> The sliding-scale balances your test score with your GPA. If you have a low test score, you need a higher GPA to be eligible. If you have a low GPA, you need a higher test score to be eligible.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">REGISTER WITH THE NCAA ELIGIBILITY CENTER</span> to ensure you meet the NCAA amateurism standards and are academically prepared for college coursework. The NCAA Eligibility Center certifies the initial <a id="p181"/>academic eligibility and amateur status of all college-bound student-athletes who wish to compete in NCAA Division-I or -II athletics.</p>
<p class="authors">These eligibility guidelines are for students enrolling full-time at a Division-I school after August 1, 2016.</p>

<h3 class="fixme green">ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY FOR A DIVISION-II COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY<a href="#note-eligibility" epub:type="noteref">*</a> &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>According to the NCAA website, to be eligible to play at a Division-II college or university, a youth soccer player must:</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">COMPLETE 16 CORE COURSES,</span> finishing at least 10 of them before the seventh semester, with at least seven of them in English, math, or natural science.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">EARN AT LEAST A 2.2 GPA IN THE CORE COURSES.</span></p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">EARN AN SAT OR ACT SCORE MATCHING YOUR CORE-COURSE GPA ON THE DIVISION-II SLIDING SCALE.</span> The sliding scale balances your test score with your GPA. If you have a low test score, you need a higher GPA to be eligible. If you have a low GPA, you need a higher test score to be eligible.</p>

<h3 id="p182" class="fixme green">ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY FOR A DIVISION-III COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY &gt;&gt;</h3>
<p>While Division-III schools do not offer athletics scho-larships, 75 percent of Division-III student-athletes receive some form of merit or need-based financial aid. If you are planning to attend a Division-III school, you do not need to register with the NCAA Eligibility Center. Division-III schools set their own admissions standards. For more information about Division-III schools, go to <a href='http://www.ncaa.org/d3'>www.ncaa.org/d3</a> or visit the websites of the schools you’re most interested in attending.</p>


<h3>IMPORTANT STRATEGIES &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Visit www.eligibilitycenter.org to learn more about opportunities available at NCAA colleges and universities.</li>
	<li>Spend time with your family researching colleges. Learn what your colleges or universities of choice look for in a student-athlete, and be realistic about your ability to succeed.</li>
	<li>Consult with your school counselor throughout high school to ensure you are on track to graduate having completed all required NCAA-approved core courses. </li>
	<li>Plan to take the PSAT exam in your sophomore year to get an idea of how you might do on the SAT exam.</li>
	<li>Plan to take the SAT and ACT exams a few times. The higher your score on these exams, the more scholarship money will be available to you at any of the NCAA colleges or universities. </li>
	<li>Maintain your grades and graduate on time.</li>
</ul>

<p id="p183"><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> It is very important that students start to focus on their grades beginning in their freshman year. Sometimes a player will think, “I don’t really need to worry until my junior year because colleges will just look at my grades as an upperclassman and my SATs. I’ll be fine.” But the reality is that colleges look at all of a student’s transcripts, and it just might be that that bad grade from your freshman or sophomore year comes back to haunt you.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">PARENTS AND COACHES &gt;&gt;</span> There are a lot of kids who have natural talent on the field and are going to be scouted by every major coach because they are such standout players. But especially if athletes want to go to Ivy League or Pac-12 schools or schools in some of the other major conferences, they need to have a very clear sense of the academic requirements. Work with your kids to understand what their scores need to look like. Spend time researching each school’s policies, minimum SAT scores, average GPA, etc.</p>
<p>Sports can take you up to a point, but the academic side is what will set a player apart—good or bad—from other athletes with similar talent and potential. Figuring out early on which schools are a good fit for your player, or what degree of academic rigor she does or does not want can help you decide together on which schools to really focus your collective energies.</p>
<p class="athlete"><span class="keyword heading">CAMILLE LEVIN &gt;&gt;</span> When it comes to choosing a col-lege, you need to choose the right school for you. Hopefully, you will have several options to consider, but listen to your gut as to which one is really the best fit. I looked at a number of really phenomenal programs that would allow a player to give a verbal commitment <a id="p184"/>before you were actually admitted to the college itself. I had a lot of friends who, as sophomores in high school, were doing just that. That was the right choice for them. For me, I wasn’t ready at that point to make a decision and, anyway, I wanted to see if I could get into Stanford academically. But Stanford won’t allow a commitment until you have already been accepted.</p>
<p class="athlete">So I waited until early in my senior year and applied to Stanford, but I continued to build relationships with the other coaches until I heard that I’d gotten in. Then I went ahead and made the commitment to play for Stanford. That may not be the right path for everyone but, for me, it was worth waiting the extra year or two to commit because the program seemed like the right place for me to be.</p>
