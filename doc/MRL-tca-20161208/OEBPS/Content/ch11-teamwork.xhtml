<h2>TEAMWORK</h2>

<p><span class="keyword heading">TEAMWORK</span> means working together as a group in order to achieve a goal. In sports, players contribute their individual skills and efforts in cooperation with their teammates to win games.</p>

<p id="p29">At Level 1, youth soccer players learn what it means to play as part of a team and not just as an individual athlete, a skill that is important at every level of play. To pass Level 1, a youth soccer player must always share the ball with other players and never hog the ball during games. She also must cooperate with coaching plans that allow everyone to participate no matter their skill level.</p>
