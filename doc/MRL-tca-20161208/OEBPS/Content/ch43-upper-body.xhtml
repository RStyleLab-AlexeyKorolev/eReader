<h2>UPPER-BODY STRENGTH</h2>

<p>College coaches are looking to separate the best players from the competition, so the margin for error is small. Your <span class="keyword">upper-body strength</span> may be the difference between getting up slowly or quickly to re-engage your opponent after a fall.</p>
<p>As expressed in previous levels, you need to keep up your upper-body conditioning to play at higher levels of soccer.</p>
<p>Pull exercises are used to increase upper-back strength and mobility, while push exercises increase chest and shoulder strength and mobility.</p>
