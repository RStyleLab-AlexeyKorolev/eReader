<h2 id="p12">DEAR ATHLETE,</h2>

<p>You have big dreams and a lot of drive. Do you know how we know this? Simply the fact that you have picked up this book and are reading it tells us that you are a young woman who wants to do more than just the minimum; you are someone who wants to develop her skills and potential. Already, you are demonstrating one of the most important aspects of making that dream become a reality. Someone who is willing to learn and is open to coaching will always be more successful than someone who thinks she already knows it all. Always.</p>
<p><cite>The Complete Athlete</cite> is designed to help guide you through your career as you grow as both an athlete and a person. It will emphasize three key areas—lifestyle, preparation, and attitude—each of which is an essential part of developing and maximizing your talent.</p>
<p>Before we begin, however, it might be helpful to consider how each of these areas contributes to your overall character and to ask yourself some questions:</p>
<p>Lifestyle means your consistent commitment to making good choices. Are you eating healthy foods? Are you sleeping as much as you should? Are you as focused on your schoolwork as you are on your athletic training? Are you avoiding illegal drugs and alcohol? Are you keeping your body and mind in top shape by maintaining a healthy body image based on what is best for your body-type—not what social pressure says you should look like? Are you spending time with positive people and in healthy relationships that won’t get you into trouble? If the answer is “no” to any of these questions, are you ready to make the necessary changes … today?</p>

<p id="p13">Preparation is your willingness to do the necessary work required to be ready every time you step onto the soccer field. It requires dedication to learning rules and practicing drills so that you have the fundamentals down-pat. It also means that you arrive at practice or games with your equipment clean and organized, and with your head in the right place so that you are ready to learn and ready to give every minute of practice your fullest and best attention. Do you have what it takes to do all the necessary “homework” to grow in every area—even when that preparation isn’t fun?</p>
<p>Attitude has to do with your maturity both in terms of how you treat others as well as yourself. Respect for your parents, coaches, and teammates is a huge part of what makes you an appealing recruit for elite teams. It doesn’t matter how good a player is; if she refuses to listen to instruction, talks back, or is someone who stirs up trouble between other players, no coach is going to want her on the team. An athlete who is willing to work hard, eager to learn, and easy to get along with is going to be a leader and standout player—no matter where she falls on the roster. Your attitude matters because it is the main way that people see how you interact with the world and how you value yourself. Can you be confident without being arrogant? Can you handle disappointment without beating yourself up? How will you react if you don’t make the shot, or don’t get invited to join the team, or don’t receive the scholarship offer? How will you react if you do? The way you handle yourself in these situations matters a great deal.</p>
<p>If you are serious about your career as a soccer player, you need to own the journey and you need to own it now. Your parents and coaches are an essential part of <a id="p14"/>reaching your goals but, ultimately, it all comes down to whether or not you are willing to put in the time and effort to become the person you need to become in order to succeed. No one else can do it for you. You must have the integrity to consistently make the right decisions about how you live, how you prepare, and about your attitude—when every eye in the stadium is glued to you, and when no one at all is looking. That is how you become more than just a soccer player. That is how you become a <span class="keyword">complete athlete</span>.</p>
