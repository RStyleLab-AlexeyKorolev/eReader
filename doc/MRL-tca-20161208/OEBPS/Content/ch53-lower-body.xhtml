<h2 id="p263">LOWER-BODY STRENGTH</h2>

<p>At Level 5, as a professional, you are at the top of your game physically; you are stronger, more explosive, healthier, and better balanced than ever before. You are staying fit during crucial practices, getting more reps because of it, and seeing the difference on the pitch. If you keep your fitness and health during practice and games, it may be the difference in making a higher salary or being chosen to play for a national team. Stronger legs have made you faster to the point of contact, and you are now out-jumping your opponent for free balls in the air or winning slide tackles. Single-leg squats are easier, your balance is top-notch, and your jumping is exceptionally high. Congratsâ€”you are ready for Level-5 testing and dominating any challenge!</p>
