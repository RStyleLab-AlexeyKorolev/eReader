<h2 id="p16">DEAR COACHES,</h2>

<p>The name of this book, <cite>The Complete Athlete</cite>, is no accident. Although your primary responsibility is to grow the young women under your care into top-notch soccer players, you also play an important role in helping them mature as whole, complete people. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a parent volunteering in the role, a good coach does so much more than just teach game skills.</p>
<p>As you read this book and review the accompanying apps, we hope that you will consider how they can complement your job both on and off the field. How can these tips and suggestions help you interact with players and their families in more meaningful and impactful ways? For example, it is important for coaches to communicate clearly with parents about what they should reasonably expect their child to learn each season or at each level. This book provides a clear set of guidelines to outline those points and help the entire unit of the team—players, coaches, and families—to operate in a healthy and mutually supportive manner. You all want the same thing: to see each and every athlete reach her fullest potential.</p>
<p>At the same time that you are teaching your athletes the fundamentals and finer points of the game, you are also teaching them about the fundamentals and finer points of being a good citizen and a responsible individual. Your attitude and example show your players the importance of being a good teammate and the satisfaction that comes with self-reliance. The way you talk about and interact with parents, game officials, <a id="p17"/>other coaches—even the waitress at the restaurant where you all go out together after a game—models for the girls what respect, appreciation, and basic manners look like.</p>
<p>Please don’t let these opportunities slip through your hands or become lost in the noise of competition. It is easy for coaches to fall into the habit of making the game about themselves, rather than their players. Wins and losses can become personal—a reflection on you and your abilities—rather than teaching opportunities for your players. Every practice, every game, every single interaction is a chance to influence these young women.</p>
<p>A good coach prepares his or her players for the game; a great coach prepares them for life! We are excited to walk alongside you as you train, push, encourage, discipline, cheer for, cry with, nurture, educate, comfort, counsel, mentor, and celebrate every member of your team. Thank you for your commitment to coaching, and thank you for your dedication to these special young people. Together, we can help them to maximize their opportunities and become more than just good players. Together, we can inspire them to become a <span class="keyword">complete athlete</span>.</p>
<p class="authors">Sincerely,
<br/>Walid Khoury, Ziad Khoury, and Dave Coggin</p>
