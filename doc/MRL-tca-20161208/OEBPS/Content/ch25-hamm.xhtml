<p>One of the most valuable lessons I learned about teamwork coupled with independent initiative came from the way I grew up. I was the fourth of six kids, and we all had a ton of chores or else the house would be a mess, things wouldn’t get done, and we wouldn’t get out the door on time. Everyone had to pitch in to make things run smoothly, and that responsibility really taught me a lot about teamwork. Because I saw it modeled effectively every day, I could understand better how those skills translated onto the soccer field.</p>
<p>Initiative mattered, too, because it was difficult with six kids to be able to make everyone’s schedules fit together perfectly. One of my parents was usually coaching or working to help us afford to be able to play, so they weren’t always available to drive us to and from practice. We had to figure out how to make it happen, whether it was riding our bikes or calling a friend and asking for a ride—we had be proactive and plan on how to meet our own responsibilities, rather than expecting our parents to keep on top of them all and drop everything to make them happen. That sense of initiative served me very well as I started to advance in the game, because I was my own source of motivation. My parents were great supporters, but they were not going to push me to practice more or work harder if I was not willing to push myself.</p>
<p>I think there are important lessons in that for athletes and parents alike. How do the lessons learned at home affect how you perform on the field? What do the lessons learned in sports translate to at school and at home? How does the way a parent acts at a game spill over into your personal life and relationships?</p>
<p id="p133">We have all seen that one parent who comes down way too hard on their child in practice or a game, yelling at them to do better, and as parents and coaches, we all resolve that we never want to be that person or allow that person to discourage our players like that. There is another aspect to consider, though, which is how you choose to express your support for your child.</p>
<p>When I was about 11 years old, something happened at a game that really impacted me. My dad was really involved in youth sports and often even refereed, which was great! But since there were six kids in my family, he and my mom were spread pretty thin in terms of making it to everyone’s games. One day, when Dad was there as just a spectator—not a ref or anything else, he was just there to watch me play—he got really into the game and started making comments at the referees. He didn’t swear or say anything terrible, but he was being loudly sarcastic, and the game was stopped so the refs could ask him to please quiet down. Eventually, they asked him to leave the sidelines, and he had to go and wait at the car until the game was over.</p>
<p>I will never forget how that made me feel. I was embar-rassed, of course, every time I heard his voice make a crack, because everyone knew that that was my dad being mouthy. But more than that, I was so disappointed that he had to leave and wasn’t able to watch me play anymore. It was such a treat to have him all to myself for a game—and then he had to leave partway through. I had to juggle both the awkwardness of having my dad get asked to leave, as well as the feelings of being let down because he wasn’t able to watch me play.</p>
<p id="p134">At this age, games are getting more competitive, and it can really get people fired up. My dad was normally a really calm, controlled guy, but something about that game just got under his skin. Parents should try to remember that they are showing just as much support of their kids by checking their behavior at games as they are by loudly vocalizing criticism of the refs or coaches. Coaches should keep this in mind, too, and try to keep their own emotions in check, as well as encourage parents to do so.</p>
<p>Most children at this age aren’t strong enough to say, “Mom, Dad—maybe you could show a little more restraint next time.” And it’s a fine line to walk, anyway, because children should be respectful of their parents and coaches, and it can be difficult to find the best way to say, “You really embarrassed me out there today with the way you were acting.” The key, I think, is to make a conscious resolution ahead of time to be honestly and purposefully aware of what you say and do. That helps create a positive experience for everyone.</p>
