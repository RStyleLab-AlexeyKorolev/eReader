<h2 id="p10">DEAR PARENTS,</h2>

<p>You have more power than you think.</p>
<p>True, this can be difficult to believe sometimes—especially during those sometimes-trying preteen and teenage years, when your daughter seems determined to question or challenge everything you say. But if you ever start to doubt how much influence you still have over your child, just pay attention the next time she makes a big play or a huge mistake in a game. Where is the very first place she looks?</p>
<p>Chances are, it is to wherever you are sitting.</p>
<p>And chances are, you are reacting to what just happened.</p>
<p>And chances are, whether you are cheering, grimacing, clapping, shouting, looking proud, looking embarrassed, or looking angry—that is going to color the way your daughter plays for the rest of the game, how she reacts to the win or loss, how she feels on the drive home, how she views the entire sport, and even how she views herself.</p>
<p>We all want the best for our children, and we all want our children to be the best at whatever they do. But what is best for one child may not be what is best for another. <cite>The Complete Athlete</cite> is a guide to managing expectations, whether your daughter is a standout player or part of the supporting cast. Often, our children can accomplish more than we imagined them capable of; other times, they are far more fragile than we suspect. How are you reacting to each victory and each disappointment?</p>
<p>As you explore each level, think seriously about what <a id="p11"/>your role is in developing your daughter into something more than just a great soccer player. What are you teaching her about responsibility when you make a consistent effort to get her to practice on time? What are you teaching her about respect with the way you speak to and about her coaches, teammates, and their families? What will you say to her about resilience when she faces defeat, or humility when she wins big? How are these lessons she will carry with her beyond the soccer field, and into life?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the right answer is obvious. Sometimes, you may not have the foggiest idea as to what you should say. That is where <cite>The Complete Athlete</cite> can help. By laying out clear guidelines with regards to the appropriate skills, game knowledge, health and nutritional demands, and personal and emotional maturity for each level, you can access tips, examples, ideas, and real-life applications both in the book and via the app. This is an interactive, multifaceted, in-the-moment approach to investing in our children’s career and character.</p>
<p>At each stage of her career—whether she is just starting out or looking to go pro—you will be your daughter’s most important and influential fan. You will always be the person who loves your daughter most of all, and vice-versa. More than her coaches, more than her teammates, how you chose to act and model your behavior will lay the groundwork for who your daughter becomes.</p>
<p>You have more power than you think.</p>
