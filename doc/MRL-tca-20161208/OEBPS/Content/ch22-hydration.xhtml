<h2 id="p102">HYDRATION</h2>

<p>All athletes need to drink water before, during, and after practices and games. This is especially important on days when both temperatures and humidity levels are high. If a youth soccer player does not drink enough water, she could suffer from dehydration.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MAINTAIN PROPER HYDRATION*&gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Before exercise, drink 16–20 full ounces within </li>
	<li>the two-hour period prior to exercise </li>
	<li>During exercise, drink 4–6 full ounces </li>
	<li>After exercise, replace 24 full ounces for every one pound of body weight lost during exercise</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES AND PARENTS &gt;&gt;</span> Players should take responsibility for following the guidelines on how much to drink before, during, and after games; parents should be monitoring to make sure it’s done the right way. If a player did not hydrate right ahead of time, she is not going to perform her best; if she did, and if she keeps up with her water intake during the game, she should be able to last through the whole game and perform very well.</p>
