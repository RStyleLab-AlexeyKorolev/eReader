<h2 id="p209">NUTRITION</h2>

<p>As a youth soccer player becomes a college student-athlete, <span class="keyword">Nutrition</span> continues to play a key role in her life, not only for optimal performance on the field of play, but also to obtain the vitamins and minerals she needs for optimal health.</p>

<h3>LEVEL 4 ATHLETE NUTRITION GUIDELINES &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p>Each individual has different macronutrient needs, based on height, weight, age, activity level, and genetic background. The following macronutrient guidelines are based on age and estimated activity level for a Level-4 athlete:</p>

<ul>
	<li>45% carbohydrate</li>
	<li>30% protein</li>
	<li>25% fat</li>
	<li>No more than 7% saturated fat</li>
	<li>No trans fat</li>
	<li>38 grams of fiber per day</li>
	<li>No more than 150 calories per day from sugar (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons) </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One of the best things about playing at a university is that you have full-time nutritionists there to work with the teams and individual athletes. We tell our players one of the first things to do when you arrive at college is to get to know that nutritionist—learn his or her name, remember it, and establish a good relationship. That person is going to play a huge part in your collegiate career if you take advantage of having that resource at your disposal. Check in with the nutritionist, listen to what he or she is telling you, and eat <a id="p210"/>and drink what they advise you to; they are professionals and have mastered what an athlete really needs for fuel as well as for recovery. Your nutritionist’s advice can be the thing that gives you the edge over other players, so make sure you follow it! <span class="attribution">—Walid and Ziad</span></p>
