<h2>UPPER-BODY STRENGTH</h2>

<p>You may now be playing against players 5–10 years older than you. You may be just as skilled, but are you just as strong? National coaches will be looking at you to separate yourself from competition, so the margin for error is minuscule. At this level, decisions may come down to match-ups with other teams just as skilled, so skill may not be what is most important at some positions. You don’t want to be on the bench due to your lack of strength!</p>
