<h2 id="p103">RECOVERY</h2>

<p>Youth soccer players need to eat and drink within 30 minutes of a practice or game to make up for the calories they are burning and fluids they are using. Replenishing calories and fluids also aids in muscle recovery and repair.</p>


<h3>HOW TO REPLENISH CALORIES AND FLUIDS &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Drink 24 ounces of fluid for every pound of sweat lost within a two-hour period of a game or practice</li>
	<li>Consume 15 grams of protein plus an equal amount of carbohydrates within the 30-minute recovery window </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="runin-head">Sleep</span> Just as increased activity creates a greater need for calories, it also creates a greater need for sleep. An athlete’s body does its growing, healing, and muscle repairing during sleep. <span class="keyword">Recovery</span> also means allowing the body to rest and heal from the demands of practices and games.</p>
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level-2 youth athlete should get 10–11 hours of sleep each night for proper growth and development. If that’s not possible, or if she needs additional recovery time, she should look at her weekly schedule and plan how she can incorporate additional sleep or rest time. To get the additional rest she needs, she can take short naps (no longer than 30 minutes) or engage in quiet rest periods (lying down, reading, or watching TV).</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One weekend, my daughter’s team had a tournament, and after the Saturday night game, she had a few friends over to stay the night. They decided <a id="p104"/>to watch a movie and the next thing I knew, they were munching away on a bunch of junk and just loading up on unhealthy stuff. They went to bed and got up early, but the next morning when we got to the field for warm-ups, they were absolutely dragging. They could barely run, barely move. I could see such a difference between them and the players who had taken care of their nutrition properly the night before; it was so obvious. Recovery is so important. Pay attention to when you drink, how much you have, what you eat, and how long you sleep in order to be ready. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
