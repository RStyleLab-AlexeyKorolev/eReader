<h2 id="p44">RECOVERY</h2>

<p>Youth soccer players need to eat and drink within 30 minutes of a practice or game to make up for the calories they are burning and fluids they are using. Replenishing calories and fluids also aids in muscle recovery and repair.</p>


<h3>HOW TO REPLENISH CALORIES AND FLUIDS &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Drink 24 ounces of fluid for every pound of sweat lost within a 2–hour period of a game or practice.</li>
	<li>Consume 5–10 grams of protein plus an equal amount of carbohydrates within the 30-minute recovery window. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="runin-head">Sleep</span> Just as increased activity creates a greater need for calories, it also creates a greater need for sleep. <span class="keyword">Recovery</span> also means allowing the body to rest and heal from the demands of practices and games.</p>
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level-1 youth athlete should get 10–11 hours of sleep each night for proper growth and development. If that’s not possible, or if a youth soccer player needs additional recovery time, she can take short naps (no longer than 30 minutes) or engage in quiet rest periods (lying down, reading, or watching TV).</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">PARENTS &gt;&gt;</span> When my daughter was this age, she would sometimes get invited to a sleepover party the night before a game, but we all know how little sleeping happens at those! What I preferred was for my daughter to have a friend on the same team come over to our house if she wanted to do a sleepover before a big game. <a id="p45"/>That way, we knew they would go to bed at a reasonable time and wake up early and ready to play. That is a form of recovery.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the first 30–45 minutes following the first game in a 2–game set is the most important for the body’s recovery. Make sure you’ve already planned what to feed them so you can get food and fluids into their system, and then they can play a bit with their friends before the next game starts. But do not let them go chasing after their teammates or running around in the first half hour or so; you need to make sure their body gets proper nutrition at the right time so they are ready for the next game. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
