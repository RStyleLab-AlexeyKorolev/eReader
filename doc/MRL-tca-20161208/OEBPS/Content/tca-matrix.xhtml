<p>Each of the pillars that helps hold up a category is part of the overall development and character of a <span class="keyword">Complete Athlete</span>. “Character,” according to Merriam-Webster, is “the way someone thinks, feels, and behaves.” All of these aspects influence what kind of a person and player you are.</p>
<p>If you look at the matrix above, you’ll see that several categories have attributes that relate to your actions off the field. What you do off the field affects how you play on the field. For instance, maintaining good fitness will make a big difference in your ability to perform the techniques needed to play soccer.</p>
<p>The key here is that just because someone is a pro-fessional player in the sense of being paid to play, he or she might not necessarily be considered a professional according to this system.</p>
<p>The next few sections of this book will discuss what you need to know, do, and be at each succeeding level in order to become a <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>.</p>
