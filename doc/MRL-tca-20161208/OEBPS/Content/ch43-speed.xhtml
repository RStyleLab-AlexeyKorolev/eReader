<h2 id="p226">SPEED/QUICKNESS/ENDURANCE</h2>

<p>There are two types of soccer speed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Straightaway speed on an open field</li>
	<li>Lateral (side-to-side) quickness</li>
</ul>

<p>The 30-yard sprint helps an athlete improve straight-away speed. The 5-10-5 shuttle run<span class="Mid-attribute-Header CharOverride-22">,</span> or pro agility drill, improves lateral quickness, because it helps to hone an athlete’s ability to accelerate, decelerate, stop, and reaccelerate without losing balance. The beep test<span class="Mid-attribute-Header CharOverride-22"></span> is a good way to measure and improve endurance.</p>

<h3>TO PERFORM A 30-YARD SPRINT &gt;&gt;</h3>


<ul>
	<li>Place two cones 30 yards apart.</li>
	<li>Starting at one cone, run as fast as you can to the other cone.</li>
</ul>


<h3>TO PERFORM A 5-10-5 SHUTTLE RUN &gt;&gt;</h3>


<ul>
	<li>Set up three marker cones five yards apart. </li>
	<li>Start at the middle marker cone in a three-point stance. </li>
	<li>Turn and run five yards to the right side and touch the marker cone with your right hand. </li>
	<li>Turn around and run 10 yards to the left and touch the marker cone with your left hand.</li>
	<li>Turn and finish by running back to the middle marker cone. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword heading">NOTE &gt;&gt;</span> Always run forward while altering your running direction, as opposed to strictly stopping and starting in opposite directions. Be sure to alternate sides each time—first time curve to the left, second time curve to the right.</p>

<h3 id="p227">TO PERFORM A BEEP TEST &gt;&gt;</h3>

<p><span class="keyword heading">NOTE &gt;&gt;</span> You’ll first need to download a beep test audio recording or beep test app, which will play beeps at set intervals. As the test proceeds, the interval between successive beeps reduces, forcing the athlete to increase her speed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Draw two lines 40 yards apart. </li>
	<li>Stand behind one of the lines, facing the second line, and begin running when instructed by the recording. </li>
	<li>Continue running between the two lines, turning when signaled by the recorded beeps. After about one minute, a sound indicates an increase in speed, and the beeps will become closer together. </li>
	<li>The test is stopped when the athlete can no longer keep in sync with the recording.</li>
</ul>
