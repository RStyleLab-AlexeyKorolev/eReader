<h2>MENTALITY</h2>

<p>Being a better athlete does not necessarily mean training harder or longer. Certainly a youth soccer player must spend time physically preparing her body to meet the demands of a practice session or game. Similarly, engaging in <span class="keyword">Mental Preparation</span> can help her perform at a higher level by creating the proper mind-set for either practice or a game.</p>
<p>At Level 1, a youth soccer player should be playing for the love of the game. While she may possess a competitive spirit and WANT to win, she should always remember that she is there to have fun.</p>
<p><span class="keyword heading">NOTE &gt;&gt;</span> If soccer is not fun for a youth soccer player, she will probably not achieve higher levels of perfor-mance. Likewise, if she’s playing soccer simply because her parents want her to participate in a sport and not because she actually enjoys the game, she may not continue playing at higher levels of competition.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MENTALLY PREPARE TO PLAY OR PRACTICE SOCCER &gt;&gt;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Take a few minutes to think about the game or practice you’re about to engage in.</li>
	<li>Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. As you slowly breathe in and out, picture yourself breathing in the fresh air as you run around the field.</li>
	<li>Think about the friends you have on the team and try to remember something funny or nice they recently said to you.</li>
	<li>Think about how much you like your teammates and respect your coaches, and vow to play your best for them—and for yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="keyword heading">COACHES &gt;&gt;</span> Starting at the younger ages and going on up through high school, I start relating soccer practice to school, because the girls can relate to school more than anything since that’s the one thing they do five days a week. When they first come to practice, they’ve had a full day and want to share their stories with each other, so there is a lot of chatter going on. I tell them they can take the first few minutes while stretching to talk and get it all out of their systems. But once I say practice has started, all the chatter I hear had better be related to soccer. I explain to them it is like being in class: When the bell rings, the focus needs to be on the teacher, the subject, and the assignments; it’s no different here. It is very important to set this pattern of expectation for players at a young age because how well they pay attention and follow directions now sets the foundation of how they are going to do as athletes. <span class="attribution">—Walid</span></p>
