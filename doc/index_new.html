                <h1>In Level 5</h1>
                <p>a soccer player has reached the highest level of her career: She is now a professional athlete. You
                    have made it to the top; now how to do stay there? Maintaining good fitness and nutrition habits
                    will help extend your playing years, but truly great players aren’t just stars in the game; they are
                    representatives of their teams, their families, and their beliefs. Learn how to be a good role model
                    as you express yourself on social media, in public and in the press, and as you interact with
                    fans.</p>

            <p>A positive <span class="keyword">attitude</span> is essential to any athlete’s success both on and off
                the playing field. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> makes a habit of
                demonstrating the following five attributes:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <!--p247-->
            <h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>
            <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you must continue to demonstrate respect for
                your coaches and game officials, your teammates and opponents, as well as yourself. As a professional
                soccer player, you should also demonstrate respect for the fans who come to see you and your team play.
                If someone asks for your autograph, be gracious and friendly. Remember, without the fans, you might not
                have a team to play on.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At the pro level right now, you’re going to start
                having fans follow you on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram—and come to your games. You’ve got to show a
                lot of respect for those fans.</p>
            <p>At the Super Cup in Sweden, you can see the players hugging fans afterward and just spending a great deal
                of time with them following the game. It is so moving to see little girls absolutely glowing as they get
                autographs from their favorite heroines. As a coach, it makes you proud to see your players making such
                a connection with the fans and as a fan; that moment of genuine engagement can mean so, so much.</p>
            <p>Don’t ever take your fans for granted and don’t ever think you are above meeting them, snapping photos,
                or shaking hands. Your supporters are a huge part of who you are as a player.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When Christen Press got drafted in the first round and
                had to share the front position with Abby Wambach, we talked about how important it was for her to give
                respect to the senior players who have paid their dues. The reason why she’s playing at the level
                <!--p248-->she is, is because these players paved the way for her. It is tremendously important when a
                rookie comes into a team that she gives the respect to the veteran players because of their experience
                and the ways that they can guide younger players on and off the field. It could be the turning point in
                a player growing as an athlete by being willing to be mentored. <span class="attribution">–Ziad</span>

            <h2 id="sportsmanship">Sportsmanship</h2>
            <p><span class="keyword">Good Sportsmanship</span> starts with respect for one’s teammates, opponents,
                coaches, and officials. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> demonstrates good
                sportsmanship by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing by the rules and never cheating</li>
                <li>Acknowledging and encouraging her teammates</li>
                <li>Accepting responsibility for her own mistakes</li>
                <li>Never arguing with the officials</li>
                <li>Winning and losing with grace</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a professional soccer player, you must always remember that you are not the only player on the team.
                Even if you’re a star player, you can’t win a game all by yourself. Demonstrate good sportsmanship by
                giving credit to your teammates and your coaches when you win a game. You should also acknowledge that
                the other team was a formidable opponent.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One of the best examples of sportsman-ship at the
                professional level was the Women’s World Cup final between Japan and the United States. It was supposed
                to be a great matchup, but the game was over by halftime with a score of 4-1. What was so amazing,
                <!--p249-->though, was that the Japanese team never argued with the referees or with one another. They
                stayed respectful and they continued to encourage one another as a team. After the game, they shook
                hands and didn’t act angry. They were being watched by their country and by the whole world, and they
                absolutely shone in terms of what real sportsmanship looks like. They were an example for every team,
                every player, and every coach to learn from. It was amazing to watch. <span class="attribution">–Walid and Ziad</span>

            <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
            <p>A soccer player who reaches the professional ranks will likely join a team that is already a tight-knit
                family. She is going to need to earn the trust of her new teammates and maintain that trust using the
                skills she has learned up to this point.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <!--p250-->
            <h2 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h2>
            <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, a soccer player simply needs to be the <span
                    class="keyword">professional</span> that she is being paid to be by representing her team and her
                sport admirably. In addition to the list of do’s and don’ts presented in Level 4, a professional athlete
                must learn how to speak to the media correctly and in a way that presents her team in a good light.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> At this level, every player has to understand that it’s
                not about the name on the back of the jersey; it’s about the name on the front of the jersey. Whenever
                you’re doing an interview or doing any charity work or involved in community activities, you’ve got to
                always remember that you’re representing a club, you’re representing your whole roster of that year,
                you’re representing the tradition that club set up in that community, and it’s not about you. It’s about
                the team.</p>
            <p>It’s really important for the players to control their emotions, especially during an interview after a
                heart-breaking loss. Know that there are thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of people
                watching that interview. They are waiting for you to see what you are going to say. Are you going to
                blame a teammate for costing you the game, or are you going to do just the opposite? Are you going to
                say, “We gave it everything and today just wasn’t our day,” or are you going to start pointing fingers?
                Remember that every single thing you say or do at that level is representing your team, your traditions,
                and your community. <span class="attribution">–Ziad</span></p>

            <h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
            <p>Whether or not a student-athlete moves into professional level play, the <span
                    class="keyword">leadership</span> skills she has developed over the years will continue to benefit
                her as she leaves college. In corporate America, as on a soccer team, a strong, confident leader can
                inspire a team to accomplish goals that they can’t accomplish on their own. This is one of the many
                reasons why many companies hire former athletes.</p>
            <p>A former player may consider coaching, moving up from introductory levels to higher Levels of coaching.
                According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of coaches is expected to increase much
                faster than the average for all occupations through 2022. Nonetheless, there will be a lot of
                competition for college and professional coaching jobs.</p>
            <p>The athlete who has developed strong leadership skills over the years will be a much more attractive
                candidate, because she will already possess the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent communication skills that allow her to effectively teach and convey information to her
                    team
                </li>
                <li>The ability to make quick decisions, especially during games and other high pressure situations</li>
                <li>Effective interpersonal skills that allow her to relate to her players</li>
                <li>Negotiation skills that allow her to solve problems in the best interest of everyone involved</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> When you’re in that little tunnel with the opposing
                team lining up next to you, and the referees are right in front of you, and you are waiting for them to
                <!--p252-->give you the green light to step on the field because the TV is going to start, and it’s
                going to be live feeding, and this is when the TV had the cameras on the team in that tunnel … imagine
                that you are standing right across from your opponent and channel that energy into your mind, your body,
                your eyes, and your voice.</p>
            <p>Recently, just before a big Premier League game between Arsenal and Lester on television, there were
                cameras on both teams and about 80,000 fans in attendance waiting for the teams to step onto the field.
                All the players were trying to look sharp in front of the camera and put a smile on their faces, but
                when that green light was given for both teams to walk on the field, Arsenal captain’s whole demeanor
                changed. In an instant it went from, “Yeah, we have a big game right now, lads,” to, “Come on, men,
                we’re going to war and we are representing all of our fans today.” It was an amazing moment to witness
                the leader forget about everything going on around him and shift his mind to a place where he knew he
                had to get his players in that state of mind. <span class="attribution">–Walid and Ziad</span></p>
            <p class="athlete"><span class="keyword">Camille Levin &gt;&gt;</span> I ended up going to Europe when I
                first entered the pros—a lot of Americans do. I was drafted by a Swedish team, and I was fortunate
                because a lot of Swedes speak English very well, so it wasn’t too big of an adjustment. But it can be
                kind of overwhelming at first to be living in a new country and not speaking the language, trying to
                learn a new culture, understanding how people work there, and how things work there in general. At the
                end of the day, though, I was there for soccer, so when you’re on the field, it doesn’t matter where you
                are or where you came from. There are different play styles and different approaches, but we <!--p253-->
                were all there to play soccer. When I was on the field, I was confident in what I was doing and I was in
                my happy place. Wherever you are, at the end of the day, you’re on a soccer field with a ball and your
                team. It doesn’t matter what language they’re speaking or what culture differences there are—ultimately,
                you’re all there for the same reason. That is a pretty neat thing about the sport and how universal it
                is.</p>

            <p>At Level 5, as a professional, you are at the top of your game physically; you are stronger, more
                explosive, healthier, and better balanced than ever before. You are staying fit during crucial
                practices, getting more reps because of it, and seeing the difference on the pitch. If you keep your
                fitness and health during practice and games, it may be the difference to making a higher salary or
                being chosen to play for a national team. Stronger legs have made you faster to the point of contact,
                and you are now out-jumping your opponent for free balls in the air or winning slide tackles. Single-leg
                squats are easier, your balance is top-notch, and your jumping is exceptionally high. Congrats you are
                ready for Level 5 testing and dominating any challenge!</p>

            <p>You may now be playing against players 5-10 years older than you. You may be just as skilled, but are you
                just as strong? National coaches will be looking at you to separate yourself from competition, so the
                margin for error is minuscule. At this level, decisions may come down to matchups with other teams just
                as skilled, so skill may not be what is most important at some positions. You don’t want to be on the
                bench due to your lack of strength!</p>

            <p>You are in the best shape of your life, playing against some of the most elite players in the world, and
                every athlete is out to either beat you or take your job—so staying healthy can be as important as
                scoring a goal. This is where having a strong core can be crucial for a soccer player. You need your
                hips to be strong to deliver accurate, crisp passes, and your lower back needs to be able to support all
                the torque that comes with kicking a ball powerfully. A weakness in your core simply means you are
                likely going to be injured sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p>For student-athletes who become one of the rare few who move on to the professional level in their sport,
                life can sometimes feel like an open book. More people are watching them play, and they are more in the
                public eye than ever before. A Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span> is one who
                continues to successfully balance all the elements in her life, including:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <!--p271-->
            <h2 id="family">Family</h2>
            <p>As a professional athlete, you should continue to strive to maintain positive relationships with your
                family members by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting aside a specific day and time each week to talk to your family by phone</li>
                <li>Communicating regularly via e-mail or text messaging</li>
                <li>Attending special family events whenever possible</li>
                <li>Reassuring your family that they are still an important part of your life</li>
                <li>Remembering that you’re in the public eye, and always strive to make your family proud</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> Whenever we do a Q&amp;A with profession-al athletes
                for our younger players, one of the most common questions we hear is, “What do you do when you have a
                bad game? How do you react?”</p>
            <p>The common denominator for the majority of the pros is that they make a separation between the game and
                their lives. After a game, they go home and spend time with their husband or boyfriend or parents or
                siblings—whatever their family situation is, they spend time with those people they love the most to
                help detach emotionally from the game.</p>
            <p>As we tell them, there is nothing we can do to change the outcome now except to look forward to
                practicing and fixing whatever didn’t go right. But they have to have that positive retreat from the
                pressure of the sport; don’t bring the negative vibe of feeling like a failure or that you let people
                down into your family space. Just knowing that until it’s time to get back on the practice field, now is
                the time to enjoy the company of family goes a long way in helping a professional play soccer at the
                highest level for a long time.</p>

            <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
            <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should have earned your degree at
                college. As a professional athlete, you should take advantage of continuing education opportunities. For
                example, some sports organizations provide signing bonuses that include money just for school. Even if
                you’re not provided with education money, you should strive to expand your mind in new and different
                ways.</p>
            <p>For example, business classes can help you later in life when you retire from sports. Taking classes just
                for fun, such as a foreign language class or an art class, can provide an opportunity to develop
                creative skills. Yoga classes can help you reduce stress and even improve your performance on the field
                of play.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> The women’s professional league draft is in December,
                so we have a lot of players who opt out of school in December to get drafted—which means they don’t
                finish their last semester of school. What many of them end up doing is to get drafted, play their
                season, but then come back to finish their last semester during the off-season.</p>
            <p>That is so important because, at the end of the day, they have invested so much time in school and they
                are so close to finishing that it would be a waste not to. Even if they get drafted, they can still go
                back and finish the degree, and we always encourage them to do so. Otherwise, what do you do if your
                career is cut short due to injury or simply when you choose to retire? You’ve got to have that degree
                for thinking about transitioning to life outside of soccer. <span

            <h2 id="social-life">Social Life</h2>
            <p>As a Level 5 <span class="keyword">COMPLETE ATHLETE</span>, you should continue to maintain a supportive
                social life. Make time for your friends when you can, and always strive to be a true friend. At the same
                time, be careful who you associate with, because you will be judged by the company you keep.</p>
            <p><span class="runin-head">ATHLETES &gt;&gt;</span> One time, we were running a camp with Paul Burns, who
                back then was the assistant coach for Newcastle United in England, in the Premier League. He said, “What
                other element do you add to the most important elements that make a soccer player? What makes a soccer
                player is their technical ability, tactical ability, psychological and physical ability, but in the
                Premier League, one of the most important things that we look for is your lifestyle.”</p>
            <p>When players begin signing contracts and making money, they often don’t know what to do with the sudden
                fame and fortune, and their entire lifestyle changes. Their social life becomes all about going out,
                partying, having a good time—and then they end up coming to games unprepared. It affects the way they
                play, as well as their mental game.</p>
            <p>Who you choose to hang around with and how you choose to spend your time makes even more difference now
                than it did when you were in school, because now you don’t have your parents to hold you accountable or
                the fear of losing a scholarship to help you make good choices. Pick the right friends, surround
                yourself with the right people, pay attention to the older players who have learned how to find the
                balance, and that will be the key to being truly successful.</p>

            <h2 id="role-model">Role Model</h2>
            <p>These days, everyone has a cell phone with a camera. For a professional athlete—or anyone in the public
                eye—one mistake can be broadcast internationally in a matter of moments. Remember that young people are
                looking up to you. Be a good role model citizen by behaving well and by engaging in charity work and
                community service.</p>
            <p class="athlete"><span class="runin-head">Kassi McCluskie &gt;&gt;</span> Now that my profession is as a
                coach, I appreciate even more how important it is to have good role models in women’s sports. Mentoring
                is so important for both the older and younger players with whom I work. As a coach, I love having a Big
                Sister/Little Sister pairing with the teams in our club so that players at lower Levels are matched with
                players at the higher Levels. The girls are encouraged to go to one another’s games to cheer each other
                on, or to make encouragement cards and signs before big games. Unfortunately, I still don’t think there
                are enough female role models out there in the world of sports, so it is really fantastic for younger
                girls to have older girls they can watch and learn from in a personal, one-on-one manner. In the same
                way, it is a wonderful leadership learning opportunity for older players to interact with the younger
                girls and think carefully not only about how to cheer for them and work on skills, but also about how
                they talk and act. I think it is a positive experience for everyone.</p>
